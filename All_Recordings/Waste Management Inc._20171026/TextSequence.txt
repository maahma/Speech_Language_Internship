Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us this morning
In a quarter where two of our biggest operating areas were heavily impacted by hurricanes, our employees maintained their focus on servicing our customers, improving core price, growing profitable volume and controlling costs to produce arguably the best quarter Waste Management has had in its history
Our operating EBITDA grew by about 7% in the quarter to $1.071 billion when compared to the third quarter of 2016. This is the second consecutive quarter of record operating EBITDA
The strong operating EBITDA continued to translate into free cash flow at a conversion rate of almost 50%
And as a result, our free cash flow grew more than 18% for the same comparative period, despite an increase in cash taxes paid and capital spending
Devina will discuss our cash flow in detail
But based upon our performance through the first nine months of the year, we are raising our full year free cash flow guidance
Our new guidance range is $1.7 billion to $1.75 billion, up from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion
We generated $0.90 of EPS in the third quarter, an increase of 7.1% when compared to the third quarter of 2016. In that EPS number was a $0.01 negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma and a $0.01 drag from the expiration of fuel tax credits
Despite these $0.02 of headwinds, we grew EPS by $0.06 versus the third quarter of 2016. Given our strong earnings performance, we are raising our full year 2017 guidance of adjusted earnings per diluted share
Our new guidance range is $3.19 to $3.21, up from $3.14 to $3.18. As we saw in the second quarter, our strong growth in EPS, EBITDA and free cash flow was driven by solid growth in revenue and operating income
Our revenues grew by $168 million or 4.7%
The majority of the revenue growth was from yield and volume growth in our traditional solid waste business
In addition, the recycling line of business contributed $52 million to our revenue growth
We continue to focus on disciplined pricing as demonstrated by core price continuing to exceed our full year target
In the third quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.7% and our yield was 2%
Our strong pricing led to income from operations growing 8.3% and income from operations margin improving 60 basis points
On the recycling front, the third quarter was solid in spite of commodity price pressure we started to see late in the quarter
Our recycling earnings grew a little more than $0.01 per share when compared to the third quarter of 2016. While prices remained strong for most of the quarter, up 26.5% year-over-year, we were impacted on the volume side, primarily due to the hurricanes in Texas and Florida, where some of our customers' recycling programs continue to be temporarily suspended
As a result, our tons sold in September were at the lowest level that we've seen in seven years and third quarter recycled MRF tons declined 9.1%
There are several issues that could impact recycling results in the fourth quarter and the early part of 2018. In July, China announced to the World Trade Organization that they were going to ban 24 materials from import into China beginning in 2018. However, this ban is expected to have a minimal impact to Waste Management given the materials that we export to China
In September, our Chinese mill customers informed us that the government was not issuing additional import licenses for recycled materials such as newsprint and cardboard
Since China has been a large customer of recycled materials, this has put the global recycling industry in a bind and forced processors around the world to find alternative markets for materials we collect every day
Thanks to our recycling group's expertise and global relationships, we've been able to leverage alternative recycling markets outside of China to further de-risk the business
Recycling is a key service offering for our customers
And I'm proud to say that our customers' materials received at our MRFs have been processed and not warehoused or landfilled as a result of this disruption
For the fourth quarter, the month of October has seen a significant drop in pricing and we now expect a negative $0.03 impact in the quarter from our recycling operations on a year-over-year basis
However, we do not expect the low pricing in October to become a new normal and while we typically would not give 2018 guidance at this time, based upon current market conditions, we expect to see a $0.04 decline in recycling earnings in 2018 when compared to 2017, heavily weighted to the first half of the year
Our recycling team has worked hard to ensure we have a sound business model and that business will continue to generate strong return on invested capital
These market conditions continue to evolve and fluctuate and we will update our assumptions when we give 2018 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call
As we've mentioned on previous calls, we've been looking for a strategic leader of our technology function
The digital era in which we all live affords us tremendous opportunities to grow our business, make it easier for our customers to do business with us using tools and platforms that meet their needs and make us more efficient than we are today
To that end, I'm very pleased to announce that Nikolaj Sjoqvist has been promoted to the new role of Chief Digital Officer
Nikolaj held the position of Vice President of Revenue Management for six years
Prior to coming to Waste Management, he spent five years with McKinsey and Company and 10 years with Compaq HP
Nikolaj has developed an in-depth knowledge of our business, customers, systems and operations
He is a firm believer in the use of data, analytics and customer insights, all of which will be important components of our company-wide digital strategy
I have no doubt that he is the right leader to take us on this new and important journey
To sum it up, we've performed very well during the first nine months of 2017. And in our third quarter, we delivered an impressive $0.10 diluted earnings per share year-over-year improvement in our traditional solid waste business
Looking into the fourth quarter, despite an anticipated negative $0.03 per diluted share impact from our recycling operations, we are raising our full-year guidance
We're confident that our employees will continue to deliver strong results in the fourth quarter and into 2018. I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our third quarter operating results in more detail
Hi, Derrick
I think it's all of the above
The way we came up with the $0.04 is that we looked at September pricing
September OCC pricing – and OCC is the commodity that's been most impacted by this, and so September OCC pricing, export pricing was down about 24% from the peaks in July
So we took a look at it and said, another 5% decline from there puts us at about export OCC pricing, about the same export OCC pricing that we saw in Q4 of 2016, which felt reasonable to us and that's the number we used to build up to a $0.04 decline in recycle earnings for 2018.
Well, I think, Derrick, I think Jim's color there reinforces why we don't feel that the October lows are the right baseline to use, that we're already starting to see, as Jim said, some promising signs coming into November
Yeah, that's the same number we used
I think, when you look at the adds (32:21), whether you look at EBITDA margins or gross margins, I mean that was certainly a good story for us this quarter
And last quarter we – it was something we talked about our brokerage business dampening it a bit and it still did
But we were just able to overcome that this quarter
I think it is sustainable going forward
We've talked about, on the EBITDA margins line being 50 basis points to 100 basis points up year-over-year and we think we'll be right in that range when we finish 2017. We continue to focus on operating costs and I mentioned it, I think, in – well, in my script and I think, Devina mentioned in hers, that – or Jim in his, that we have some technology that we're putting into place
We are continually focused through our onboard computers on improving operating costs through efficiency gains
Devina, I know mentioned that SG&A is an area that we have always been focused, at least over the last five years to six years and we're pleased with the results there, so
And then, I think the last thing that I would say, Hamzah, is that what we're really seeing and it's affecting margins, is that we're starting to see the leverage of kind of 2% price and 2% volume
It's something that Steiner mentioned several times over a couple year period and we were never quite able to get there, although we made good strides
We've finally gotten there and it's really, really showing up in spades in our – not only in our EBITDA and free cash flow, but also in our margins
Here's what I would say about the hurricanes
I mean, first of all, in terms of predicting the benefit to us and there will be a benefit to us
But in terms of predicting that benefit for – whether it's Q4 or the first part of 2018, it's a bit difficult and I'll give you an example of why it's hard
In Texas for example, in Houston specifically, a lot of that Hurricane debris has gone to these temporary holding areas
And I assume that the reason for that was to get it off of people's yards as quickly as they could
So a lot of the debris has not yet made its way to landfills and so we think there is some real opportunity
The collection side of the business is really handled for the most part by FEMA and so we don't see a whole lot on the collection side
Where we ultimately see benefit from natural disasters is in the landfills
And then once reconstruction begins, we see it in our roll-off line of business
And then as I mentioned in my script, Hamzah, we saw a bit of it just through the temporary suspension of recycling programs in the recycle line of business
To kind of put a cap on this, we think that it's probably somewhere in the neighborhood of a $0.02 impact for us, a bit hard to predict because we're not exactly sure how much volume is out there in either Florida or in Texas, but we think it's probably a $0.02 benefit, could be a little bit higher, could be a little bit lower, but somewhere in that neighborhood over the coming months
Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
Thanks a lot
Yes
Look, it's not that we didn't see this coming, but we felt like in July, look, we're halfway through the year, let's – I think every time we've ever raised guidance in the past, we've waited until the third quarter to do it, because things can happen throughout the year that – and what you don't want to do is raise your guidance and then find out that you didn't anticipate something or something happened that's caused the other direction
So I mean, I would answer your question by saying two things
One is, we knew we were having a good year when we were on our second quarter earnings call, but in the interest of being reasonably conservative, we wanted to wait until third quarter to really kind of reaffirm that, and that's why we're raising guidance in Q3.
Yeah, I think, Michael, just to tag on to Devina's comments
Really, the two things that have – this is a story about EBITDA and working capital when it comes to cash from operations
And it's – Devina mentioned, the reasons behind working capital and the procure to pay program, or technology we put into place, but also really strong landfill volumes, really strong volumes across the board, and those landfill volumes and our overall volumes continue as we look at the month of October
I was just going to say, CapEx comes in right where we said it would, which is the high end of the original guidance
We originally guided $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion and I believe last quarter we said we'd be at the high end of that
And so we're going to come in right at the high end of that CapEx number
I mean, if you look at the storm debris, Michael, for the third quarter and I went through kind of our expectations for Q4 and beyond
But if you look at the third quarter, really the revenue impact for the third quarter was only $1.28 million and that seems amazing, but it's not that surprising when you consider that there is an initial kind of hit both on revenue and on operating cost
The operating cost impact was almost $3.1 million and add to that the SG&A impact from the donations and you get to a negative $6 million for the third quarter and that's where you get the $0.01 in Q3.
Yeah, a little bit less than $7 million
Pretty soon you're going to talk us into giving guidance here for 2018.
Yeah, I mean, look, I think we feel – here's the bottom line
I mean I think, we feel very good about the operating leverage of the business
We feel good about the volumes that we're seeing and the kind of 7% to 8% growth that we're seeing in EBITDA
As Devina mentioned, CapEx is a bit of a – I wouldn't say a wildcard because that implies that we don't control it, we do
But we may or may not be in that 9% to 10% range in 2018. She talked a bit about why
One thing she did mention was investing more heavily in our CNG fleet, because we're seeing a very nice payback for a CNG truck versus a diesel truck in terms of not only the cost of fuel, but also maintenance cost
So I think, we feel good about the long-term growth prospects of the business and we'll talk more about where we think free cash will be for 2018, when we get to the beginning of the quarter next year
So, far that's what we're looking for
Good morning, Tyler
We think it's probably $0.02 in the fourth quarter
Well
No, I don't think they're going to be down
I mean, there are always some reasons why year-over-year comps can be difficult and Jim talked about that a bit for Q3, actually having one that was a positive for us that will cause next year to be a difficult comp for us
But, I think largely MSW volumes are driven by two things, driven by us differentiating ourselves and taking potentially a bigger slice of the pie and then driven by the overall growth of the pie itself
I would tell you that on the overall growth of the pie, that the economy feels reasonably good right now
As we look out into 2018, we don't see any storm clouds on the horizon, not that they couldn't show up, but right now it looks reasonably good
And then part of why we're excited about putting Nikolaj in the technology position is that we're already starting to separate ourselves through the use of things like customer analytics and use of data reporting and then technology to our customer in terms of a customer interface
So differentiation in the economy give us some room for optimism here as we think about MSW volumes and total volumes going into 2018.
It was just going to say, for Q3, Tyler, it was about $8 million, right
So the $25.6 million increase in absolute dollars in SG&A cost year over year, about $8 million of it was related to that
Thank you
I would tell you, Jeff, that while wage inflation is certainly a consideration for us, maybe an even bigger consideration is tackling turnover and making sure that we are doing everything we can to limit the amount of turnover that we have
It's a fact of life for us but to the extent that we can limit it, is a huge, huge value for us
There is a significant cost to every employee, be that a driver or a technician or an accountant when we turn them over and the training cost and kind of the ramp up are all costly to us
So we have put a real focus on reducing turnover
Morning, Corey
Yeah, I mean, look, I think the underlying trends are good
I briefly mentioned when Michael was questioning us about October
And so October looks very strong
It's always hard to tell what volumes are going to do, looking six months out
We do have a pipeline in our special waste stream that looks promising
C&D was a bit of a – kind of, I wouldn't say a disappointment, because it was expected after the hurricanes, but C&D was definitely impacted by the hurricanes
It's coming off of a small base
And when you don't take in C&D material for a period of two weeks to three weeks in two big C&D markets, Florida and Texas, that affects C&D
So we think C&D will return to more kind of normal numbers
MSW we talked about
And then on the collection side we're very encouraged with the commercial line of business
That's been performing very well for us, continues to perform well when we look at the month of October
Resi has been the one that has been negative for us, it's the only one that's been negative for us and we continue to focus on that, on improving the residential line of business, it's an important line of business for us
We've made some progress there, but still negative and need to continue to work on it
Corey, it's about – 10 basis points of CPI equates to about $0.01 per share for us
Based on the most recent 12 months, we've seen about 10 basis points, I mean a little more, about 12 basis points improvement in CPI and so that will equate to about $0.01 per share in 2018.
Yeah
So, just the title itself, we felt like Chief Digital Officer was probably more representative of the job that Nikolaj was going to do coming in
It felt a little bit more like kind of a 21st Century title than a 20th Century title
So that's why we changed it a bit
But, I mean, look I would tell you that Nikolaj has a big job in front of him, because it's such an important part of our growth strategy, and it includes things like customer facing technologies, both internal customers and external customers
We tend to think solely about external customers and it's both
It's the use of big data
We've talked a bit about predictive maintenance and how we're already starting down that path and it's already starting to show some promise
And then asset management technologies, there is a whole list of things that I think you'll see this Chief Digital Officer position and Nikolaj in that role, really start to leverage
We visited our national accounts group last week and look, national accounts competes against kind of low margin, low frills brokers all the time
And what we're doing is putting some advanced analytics to use and rolling out a sophisticated reporting tool that really separates us, that differentiates us from those low margin low frills guys
Those are all technologies and difference kind of under that big technology umbrella that that we hope to help differentiate us in the coming years
Well
So, we've said for this year at least, 50 basis points to 100 basis points of margin improvement on the EBITDA margin line
Going forward, we haven't kind of nailed those down yet, but we did say, we still believe that we have margin expansion opportunities either on the gross margin line or down at the EBITDA margin line in 2018 and we'll be more specific about that in February
And then what was the second part of your question?
Sure, no, recycling certainly is still on the list and we have done a couple of small strategic recycling acquisitions
They tend to be really almost exclusively where we have either not had a presence or where we can really – where we're buying into a recycling business that is a strong return, strong business, strong margin business
There are a couple of places, specifically in Florida, also in Tennessee where I think we bought recycling operations over the past two years
And so, it is certainly still on the list for us as are some of the other kind of ancillary businesses that are not necessarily straight down the middle of the fairway, core solid waste
But for the most part, the $100 million to $200 million range that we've given is going to be comprised more of straight down the middle of the fairway, solid waste tuck-ins
And I would just add that that's the really encouraging part about this quarter is – and really the last several quarters, is that it's really almost been all organic growth
It has not been driven by acquisitions, nothing wrong with acquisitions, we like acquisitions, but I would tell you that we're growing cash from operations by 13% and EBITDA by 8% or 7% and free cash by 18% and we're doing it organically and that's the encouraging part about these last couple of earnings reports
Good morning, Barbara
Okay, thank you
Well, this was an excellent financial and operating quarter for Waste Management
We're very proud of that
But at the same time we recognize that the hurricanes in Southeast Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico and the fires in California have taken a heavy toll on the lives of people who were in the path of those disasters and I tell you, it reemphasizes to all of us, the roles that we play as compassionate human beings and those are truly the most important roles we play each and every day
So, thank you again for your time today
We'll see you next quarter and go Astros
