Thanks Jim
On Slide 9, you'll see our third quarter financial results
Please note with the exception of cash flow, all these financials are on a non-GAAP basis
Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix
Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $465 million a 15% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016 and as Jim mentioned an 8% organic growth rate
Adjusted gross margin was 49%, about 70 basis points higher than last year, driven by acquisitions and improved manufacturing cost
Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 22% about 20 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to higher R&D spend relative to the prior year
Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2017 was up 11% to $72.7 million and adjusted EPS was $0.52 per share, 8% higher than last year
Net income was negatively impacted by a 370-basis point increase in our effective tax rate versus last year to 26.2%
Due to our current expectation and geographic mix of taxable income, we now expect our full-year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25.5%
Quarterly cash flow from operations was 143% of adjusted net income or $104 million, which was $15 million higher than the prior-year
Through nine months of 2017, operating cash flow was 116% of adjusted net income
During the third quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $86 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and returned $21 million to shareholders in the form of dividends
Despite these uses of cash, we increased our cash balance by $33 million to $437 million at the end of the quarter
Geographically, revenue increased 9% in the U.S
and 27% in Europe
We saw weakness in the Middle East region due to slower activity in our Surveillance segment
Revenue to U.S
government was 25% of total revenue and it increased 4% versus the prior year
Moving into segment details on the right side of Slide 9, revenue and operating income increased across the Board
We did experience reduced operating leverage in the form of higher corporate spend, the result of increased legal costs and increased compensation accruals
Digging in on the segment a bit more, you will see on the left side of Slide 10, a summary of surveillance in the third quarter results
Third quarter revenue for surveillance was $146.8 million up 8% from the third quarter of 2016. Airborne and man portable products were particularly strong, compared to the prior year and the addition of the UAS business added inorganic revenue growth all partially offset by a decline in our land products due do a difficult comparison in the prior year
Operating income for surveillance was $44.9 million up 8% over the prior year with consistent operating margins
Surveillance bookings grew to 33% during the year due to a $75 million order we received from the U.S
Army for gimbels to support their EOIR Force Protection Program, a variant of the RAID program
This helped drive surveillance and book-to-bill ratio of 1.45 times and increased backlog 21% quarter-over-quarter to $395 million
Not included in this backlog, but notable nonetheless in October, our UAS business receded a $7 million order from the Australian Army for our Black Hornet Nano UAS Solution, a key stone win for this next generation personal surveillance and reconnaissance solution
On the right side of Slide 10 is a summary of the Detection segment, which saw third quarter revenue grow 19% year-over-year to $31.4 million
Timing of deliveries under the DR-SKO program and increases in our radiation and ChemBio products drove the increase, which was partially offset by softness in explosives detection products
Operating margin improved 180 basis points to 28%, a result of higher revenue on the operating expense base
Detection finished the third quarter with $78 million of backlog, which was down $8 million from the end of Q2, due primarily to the shipments of DR-SKO under the previous order
Partially offsetting the backlog decline was another large order from the United States Department of Homeland Securities Domestic Nuclear Detection Office for our R300 Compact Spectroscopic Personal Radiation Detectors
Moving to Slide 11, instruments revenue of $91.4 million was up 11% over the third quarter of 2016. Broad product line growth drove this increase with particular strength in both volume and premium handheld plant predictive maintenance cameras as well as growth in our automation cameras
Instruments operating profit in the third quarter increased 7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $29.6 million or 32% of revenue
The results for the OEM and emerging segment are shown on the Slide 11 as well
OEM and emerging third quarter revenue was $87.2 million, increasing 39% over last year
The acquired integrated imaging solutions line of business was the driver of this growth
Organic revenue was slightly up due to higher sales of UAS cameras, mobile accessories and Lepton cores offset by slower cooled cores revenue
OM and emerging operating profit grew 30% year-over-year to reach an all-time quarterly high of $26.9 million, operating margin of 31% did decline 200 basis points versus the prior year, due to higher operating expenses, primarily related to product development and yield improvement initiatives
Order backlog and OM and emerging increased 2% during the third quarter to $162 million
Moving to Slide 12, on the left side, you'll see security segment revenue of $65.7 million was up 16% compared to last year's third quarter
Securities LOREX business grew significantly due to sell-ins of our new 4K Ultra HD bundle and our wire-free camera system to two major retailers, some of which was revenue pushed in from Q2. We saw significant growth in LOREX web channel as well
FLIR-branded Professional Visible Security solutions grew 12% year-over-year, while thermal security products were flat to the prior year
Security operating income grew 36% to $6.5 million year-over-year due to the strong topline and a reduction in operating expenses
In the quarter, we restructured the security segment to improve their selling function, their R&D strategy and reduced SG&A by approximately $1 million annually
A portion of these segments will realize in the third quarter
Maritime segment revenue was $42.3 million, up 4% versus the prior year, despite the negative impact of Hurricanes in the U.S
New products drove broad growth across the Raymarine business, which was partially offset by weakness in thermal cameras due to increased customer vetting processes
Maritime operating income grew 42% to $4.5 million or 11% of revenue
Stronger gross margins mix with controlled operations spending resulting in another quarter of operating margin improvement, this time by 280 basis points compared to Q3 of 2016. That concludes my summary of the financials and the segments
I'll now pass it back over to Jim
Drew, we've been a fairly acquisitive company
We intend to be -- continue to be acquisitive
So, we want to have that firepower let's say on the ready for when we want to do deals
How far can we take it, it's basically investment grade rated
we like being investment grade rated
We can leverage that in a lot of different ways across our company
But if the right deal comes along, there is a chance that we could take it above 2.5 times, but we just havenâ€™t seen deals like that
So, where we sit today is still looking and I've been spending a lot of my time trying to rebuild our pipeline from M&A and by rebuild we've kind of processed through a lot of the deals especially in 2016. We did four of those deals
So, we intend to be doing some more acquisitions
So, we want to make sure we have the bandwidth to do that and that's part of the reason we did pay down that revolver
There was a couple other reasons like swap gain that we realized and a couple other reasons, but yeah, we like having that bandwidth and that's hasn't changed over these last let's say six months
Q1 was a really tough comp
Q3 also was a tough comp
It's choppy Noah as you know, it's big orders that we get
Deliveries get choppy, but if you look at on a trailing 12-month basis, yes, it's been a very difficult comp and it's a couple of big orders that we got last year
