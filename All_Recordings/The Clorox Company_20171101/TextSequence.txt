With that, I'll cover our Q1 business performance, discussing highlights in each of our segments
Steve will then address our financial results as well as our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018. Finally, Benno will close with his perspective on the business followed by Q&A
For the total company, first quarter volume and sales, each grew 4%, with sales growing across all four segments
Sales in tracked channels remain healthy and we continue to see very strong growth in non-tracked channels, particularly in e-commerce and clubs
I will now turn to our results by segment
In our Cleaning segment, Q1 volume and sales, each grew 5%
Sales growth this quarter also include less than two points of benefits from shipments related to the recent hurricane
Cleaning segment's strong top line growth was led by home care, which grew by high-single digits on top of the double-digit growth in the year-ago quarter
We're very pleased by the continued momentum of our largest SBU, especially as the growth continues to reflect broad-based strength across the Clorox equity portfolio, with all-time record shipments of Clorox Disinfecting Wipes, as well as our recently introduced Scentiva wipes and sprays
Consistent with these results, home care delivered its 13th consecutive quarter of market share gains
In laundry, sales and volume grew mainly behind shipments of Clorox liquid bleach, as retailers stock-up for hurricane-related purchases
The quarter's results also reflect continued growth in our premium Clorox Splash-Less bleach resulting in share gains on total Clorox liquid bleach
Lastly, within the Cleaning segment, our professional products volume and sales were flat, reflecting the divestiture of the Aplicare business in late August
The balance of professional products business is performing strongly
Turning to Household segment, first quarter volume increased 7% and sales grew 5%, with broad-based growth across all business units
Starting with our Glad bags and wraps business, sales growth was driven by ongoing success from our premium OdorShield trash bags, especially in e-com and the club channel as well as slight gain from hurricane-related shipments
In Charcoal, volume grew slightly while sales declined slightly, due to unfavorable mix as well as higher trade promotion investments to support our business
We continue to feel good about our plans for this business going forward and the category is healthy
Cat Litter volume and sales each grew by high-single digits behind our Fresh Step innovation and strong merchandising support
We're pleased with the strong momentum we are seeing on this business as reflected by four consecutive quarters of market share growth
Finally, turning to RenewLife, Q1 was the first full quarter lapping the acquisition
We're pleased to report high-single digit sales growth behind distribution expansion, leveraging our sales capabilities
Additionally, we started distribution within the club channel in October
In our Lifestyle segment, volume increased 2% and sales grew 4%
Burt's Bees delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter, behind the introduction of our new natural cosmetics line, and first-ever distribution expansion of lip care in the club channel
Burt's Bees grew share in the quarter and we're very pleased with our share gains in the lip color category
In our Brita business, volume and sales declined as gains from innovation behind our new Stream pitcher were more than offset by lower club channel merchandising and a strategic choice to rationalize a lower-margin part of our portfolio
That said, the Stream pitcher is performing well six months after launch, and is now the number two pour-through item behind our Brita Legacy pitcher, which is the market leader
To wrap up Lifestyle, food volume and sales grew behind strong merchandising in club and grocery channels for bottled Hidden Valley dressings
Consumptions remain very strong, and we are especially pleased that our Hidden Valley brand delivered 11th consecutive quarter of share growth
Finally, turning to International
Volume was down 2%, although sales grew 1%
Sales growth reflects the benefits of pricing and innovation, partially offset by unfavorable mix and weaker volume in Argentina due to macroeconomic conditions, and in Puerto Rico, from the impact of the hurricanes
We continue to focus on our Go Lean strategy to drive margin improvement, while selectively investing in Burt's Bees, RenewLife, laundry and home care
Now, I'll turn it over to Steve, who'll provide more information on our Q1 performance and discuss our updated outlook for fiscal year 2018.
We'll take one more question
