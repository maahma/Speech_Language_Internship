Thanks, Rodney, and good morning everyone
Kroger’s market share grew for the twelfth year in a row
Our consistent market share gains drive both top and bottom line growth and generate blasting shareholder value
We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it where they spend the money
According to Nielsen Plus data, Kroger’s overall market share with the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points in 2016 with 14 of 22 markets up too flat and six markets down
Starting in 2017, we plan to begin using IRI point of sale data to measure market share
While we expect there to be some differences in share reporting between Nielsen and IRI, we expect those differences to be minimal
Regardless of the source, we use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one
It is also worth noting that market share data is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales
Looking at ID sales, deflation was the primary driver of our negative results for the quarter
Inflation adjusted ID sales were positive in the fourth quarter
Deflation excluding fuel persisted at 1.3% compared to 1.1% in the third quarter
During the quarter, we saw decline in pharmacy inflation and acceleration in produce deflation and a slowing in grocer deflation
Another headwind to ID sales was our capital program
Over the last four quarters, we relocated or expanded 35 strong performing stores taking them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation
This caused about 70 basis point headwind to ID sales in the fourth quarter
Tonnage was positive during the fourth quarter and we continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products which by the way hit nearly $16 billion in sales in 2016 in areas where we are saving customers time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions
We always give a little insight into our ID sales data
Visits per household and price per unit were down in the fourth quarter but those were slightly offset by basket size and household growth
Loyal households continue to grow at a faster rate than total households which was true for both the quarter and the year
It is interesting to note that loyal household had slightly positive ID growth in the fourth quarter
Operating, general and administrative costs as a rate of sales excluding fuel, recent mergers, and a $30 million contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2015 declined by 11 basis points; rent and depreciation with the same exclusions increased by 24 basis points
While this result was better than the third quarter, we can and will do better
We are working diligently to pull costs out of the business and improve processes to lower cost as a rate of sales and deliver value to customers
Now, for an update on retail fuel, in the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.172 compared to $0.169 in the same quarter last year
The average retail price of fuel was $0.0218 versus $0.0192 in the same quarter last year
For 2016 in total, we are at $0.171 for the year and $0.174 in 2015. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.31 times compared to 2.08 times during the same period last year
This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and increases in working capital
The increase in working capital is driven by higher inventory in four locations where we open new or expanded distribution centers
When doing this, we duplicate inventory for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition
Also, accrued liabilities are lower due to lower incentive plan payout accruals
This fortune will reverse in the first quarter when incentive plan cash payments will be lower
It is worth noting that over longer time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow
This is because we continue to work with our unions to modify pension plans
We continue to negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates’ future benefits as we did in the second quarter
These restructurings do not change the total obligations of the company because the debt we add is offset by a reduction in the amount of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations
In 2016, Kroger used cash to repurchase $1.8 million in common shares, paid $429 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and to merge with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million
Capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities total $3.6 billion for the year compared to $3.5 billion last year
The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy
Return on invested capital for 2016 was 13.09%
This result was affected by current year results and recently merged companies
We are committed to growing return on invested capital with the long term
I will now provide a brief update on labor relations
We recently agreed to a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy’s distribution center and with the UFCW for North Carolina clerks and meat associates
We are currently negotiating contracts covering store associates in Atlanta, and Michigan
Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable healthcare and retirement benefit for our associates
Kroger’s financial results continue to be pressured by rising healthcare and pension costs with some of our competitors do not face
Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates with importance of growing Kroger's business and doing it profitably, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates
Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017, we anticipate identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to range from flat to 1% growth for 2017. We expect net earnings to range from $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.09 benefit for the 53rd week
We anticipate the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar to the second half of 2016. Our results in the second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle to previous year
We recognize that this is an unusual year and that’s why we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compared to our long-term guidance rate as we’ve done in the past
In fact for the first quarter, we are going to give you an earnings per share range, which is not something we plan to do over the long-term, but we think it’s important to be very clear about how we think the year is going to progress
For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the first quarter to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range, the second quarter to be slightly up compared to last year, the third quarter to be up strongly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be up high-single digits compared to last year without the benefit of the 53rd week
Our guidance for the year excludes the estimated cost of the voluntary retirement offer, but does include the anticipated expense savings, which we will reinvest in the business
Over the long-term we are committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend
We expect a LIFO charge of $25 million for the year
We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Capital expenditures in 2017 will be focused on sales generating initiatives, remodels, upgrades to our logistics network and merchandising systems and digital and technology initiatives
As we invest more in these areas, our investment in stores will be reduced
As we anticipate Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2017, excluding fuel, to decline approximately 10 basis points compared to 2016 results
Now, I will turn it back to Rodney
Sure, John
As I’ve said in the prepared remarks, we do expect the first half of the year to be much like how 2016 ended and it's really just carrying the current trends out through the first – as you know this is a 16-week quarter for us – through those first 16 weeks of the year
And we see the clarity to some of the programs Rodney mentioned and the fact that we continue to drive unit growth
We do expect to see the recovery in the sales later in the year
John Heinbockel Okay, thank you
No
As I said in the prepared remarks, as we finalize what the expense of that will be, that will be reflective in the first quarter
The offer is not entirely close so we won’t know until next week exactly how many people ultimately accepted the offer
And there will be varying times when people ultimately retire so that does go throughout the year as those folks ultimately retire
Do keep in mind as I said in prepared remarks was we do not have the expense of the plan in our estimates
We do have the savings in their plan and/or a portion of what we plan to invest to increase the value proposition for our customers
We did not give any specific guidance on the level of buyback we’ll do and obviously it depended on market conditions as well as our Board being willing to give us incremental authorization
We will run out of our existing authorization here in the very near term
We’ve been buying shares since late last year and all through so far this year off of the greatest average 10b5-1. So we’re somewhat predicated and our Board given this incremental authority
I can tell you there were lot of efforts we have underway to reduce our total cost of doing business and it’s in a variety of areas
We can do better on shrink, we can do better on store productivity in some areas, we can certainly do better on in stock in some areas
And one of the great things about being in a company of this size and breadth of Kroger is, there is not an initiative we have out there that we don’t already have, a very large group of stores achieving
We don’t have to go outside the company and point to competitor actually doing this so we are
Every metric we have out there for our storage to do better on, we already have a group of stores achieving those results, and as we get better at achieving those over a broader base of stores, that’s one of the things that we think is going to give us incremental fuel for the engine to continue to invest in the four piece
Thanks, Karen
I think you’re doing what a lot of people do including this morning when I was on CNBC of mixing inflation and deflation at cost and retail
When we talk about our inflation or deflation it’s our product cost inflation or deflation
You kind of through and what’s going to happen to retail product cost inflation or deflation
And overall, we do think that we will return to a slightly inflationary environment in the back half of the year
It is interesting to note that despite the fact that we pretty much add, I think Rodney was talking before with one of the callers, nine quarters in a row of deflation, declining inflation/deflation
I’ll be there inflation coming down or actual deflation, it’s nine straight quarters now but that trend volume would be down
So it’s been obviously fairly persistent
Despite that, even though we had a lot lower pharmacy inflation in the quarter that still generated a very large LIFO charge, it was offset by other areas that had deflation
So it’s a completely mixed bag
Even in the fourth quarter, grocery inflation over the course of the quarter was basically half of what it was in the third quarter but produce inflation went up 600 basis points or deflation expanded by 600 basis points, and that was over 7% deflation in the quarter
So it’s a huge mixed bag of what’s out there and I’m not going to pinpoint an exact number because I’ve proven over the years that I can predict a totally inaccurate number on inflation or even LIFO, but we continue to manage through the process that we have
The promotions by category, we would use our 8451 insights for that and it would really be different by customer, some of it would be things that you would do personalized one-on-one
So, it actually – if you go into the store from checking the retail price you wouldn't see it because of its offers that are made directly to customers, sums via coupons
It's all the above because different customers react different ways to different promotions, so it’s becoming increasingly personalized offers based on what that particular customer wants and desires are
And it would be a mix of national brand, corporate brands and fresh product and others, so it's really a mix on the comp by quarter
Mike, I will let you…
Yeah, if you to repeat your question, I want to make sure I’m answering the question you are asking, not what I have in head
Well the comment about we expect the first quarter to look a lot like the first quarter, I guess, would be a little bit of coat for ID sales continue to be a little bit negative right now, which means we expect ID sales to recover as we go throughout the year
And that's going back to the questions that we've gotten on the cadence of how we expect to see the underlying EPS is that is predicated on an improvement in ID sales throughout the year
Is what it typically is
And when you look at the number of stores we did over the last year compared to two or three years ago, it’s about double, major store projects
Well, as those stores are open long enough they will flip back into our ID store base
And we would hope they continue to perform the way they are in the tailwind ID sales
And as I’ve said in the prepared comments, we are taking capital down from what we would originally plan to spend in 2017 because we've been guiding folks to think about 2017 and even 2018 to be a similar spend level that we did 2016 and most of that will come out of new store
And we will continue a strong remodel program, so when we remodel a store, it does not come out of IDs, it's only an expansion or relocation or a net new that winds up affecting it
I think it will continue for a while, but it will decline over time as those stores become identical again
And if you look at the prior year, we didn't have much weather either and in fact the only one big weather event we had was the last weekend of the year in last year's numbers
So our year ended against the only weather event we had in the prior year with no weather this year
Robby, I would be in Rodney's boat from an insight standpoint
My conclusion, without meeting with some other folks and having conversation, would be that the timing of those doesn't affect us in a big way like it does other folks because over my time here at Kroger I've never heard anybody talk about I can't wait till tax refunds drop so we can get a boost in sales
So it just doesn't – I agree with what Rodney's conclusion is based on most of what we sell
But those are all great big Fred Meyer stores with a lot of general merchandise
So if you look at the – if you look at Roundy's overall, we continue to be very happy with what Michael Marks and team were doing in Wisconsin as well as Don Rosanova and team in Chicagoland with the two banners
Mike and team have cycled through the first set of store remodels and offerings to the customers who are now in second market getting remodels completed and then we'll put a full campaign in that market
And then if we continue to see the positive reaction from the customers from ID sales dollars and units, we’d expect to continue to roll that out throughout the state
From an ID stand sales standpoint, it really didn't affect it very much in the quarter certainly not as much as it did earlier in the year
We have time for one more question
And different category reinventions with coffee and pet and baby where we’ve totally redone to look and feel those departments for our customer
