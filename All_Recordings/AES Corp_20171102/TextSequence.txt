Well, good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 financial review call
Today, Tom and I will discuss our results for the quarter and year-to-date as well as our progress on our strategic and financial goals
We are reaffirming our prior guidance for 2017 and our expectations through 2020. During the third quarter, we made significant progress on our construction projects and the integration of our renewable acquisitions
This morning, I will provide some color on the returns we expect to realize from these investments
I will also discuss our plans to accelerate and expand our asset sales program and cost-cutting and revenue-enhancement initiatives
Before turning to these areas, I’ll first discuss the impact of the recent hurricanes on our businesses in the Caribbean
Our sympathies are with the people of Puerto Rico, many of whom are still without power and water
Our number one priority before, during and after the recent hurricane was the safety of our people and their families and impacted communities
Fortunately, our people and their families are safe, and our two plants in Puerto Rico sustained only minor damage
Both plants are currently available to meet their obligations under their PPAs
We expect the local transmission system to be energized and ready to take our much-needed power by the end of November
Tom will discuss the effects of the hurricanes in our financial results for the third quarter in more detail
Today, we’re announcing that we will be significantly upsizing our asset sales program
We now expect to realize $2 billion in proceeds during the 2018 to 2020 period
Approximately $1 billion of this is expected to occur by year-end 2018, including the sale of Masinloc, our coal plant in the Philippines
Interest remains very strong, and we expect to sign this sales agreement before year end and receive the proceeds early next year
We’re also announcing that we are aggressively pursuing significant additional cost savings
These G&A and O&M savings are likely to be earnings neutral in 2018 due to onetime restructuring costs, but accretive to 2019 and beyond
We will provide more detail on our fourth quarter call
Turning to Slide 4 and our construction program, which is the key driver of our growth
Milestones were being met across our 5 gigawatts of projects under construction, including Alto Maipo in Chile
Although the Alto Maipo project has experienced construction delays and cost overruns, it is making progress towards overcoming these challenges
First, the smaller of the two main contractors, CNM, was terminated
The Tunnel Boring Machine they had been operating is now being operated by Robbins, its manufacturer
They’re progressing at a multiple of the historical rates achieved by CNM, and the Alto Maipo project is now 58% complete
Second, Alto Maipo is in negotiations with various contractors for a fixed price, lump sum EPC contract
The new EPC contract would include substantial capital and performance commitments from the contractor, incentivizing timely completion
The restructuring would also require additional concessions from the project lenders and meaningful contributions from AES Gener, which would be tied to construction milestones
The objective is to significantly reduce execution risks and preserve the value of Alto Maipo while, at the same time, remaining disciplined with additional equity from AES Gener
We will provide you with updates as Alto Maipo continues to make progress on these negotiations
Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on Slide 5. Our 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana is on track to achieve commercial operations in the first half of 2018. Construction is 99% complete, and the project is now in the commissioning phase
In fact, this past weekend, the project achieved a major milestone with the first fire of the turbine
The unit was synchronized to the grid and produced its first electricity
Now turning to our 1.3 gigawatt Southland CCGT project on Slide 6, which is a repowering of our existing gas generation facilities in Southern California
Construction is ongoing, and the project is on track to be operational by the first half of 2020. Our remaining construction projects are proceeding as planned, including our thermal plant, OPGC 2 in India; and our CCGT and LNG regasification terminal, Colón, in Panama
These projects will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020. Turning to Slide 7. We have been reshaping our portfolio to reduce our carbon intensity and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders
To that end, our growth initiatives beyond the projects under construction have been focused on investments in natural gas and renewable projects with long-term U.S
dollar-denominated contracts in our existing markets
On a portfolio basis, these investments are expected to produce average returns in the low teens
These compelling returns are driven by several factors, including investing in markets with lower renewable penetration and faster growth rates than the U.S
; using local debt capacity in the businesses to fund the investments; and using our business platforms and global scale to lower costs
Our project returns also benefit from bringing in partners to reduce our equity commitments while providing management and development fees
I’ll walk through some specific examples of how we have boosted returns on some of our recent investments, beginning on Slide 8. In July, we closed on our acquisition of sPower with the Alberta pension fund, AIMCo
We are encouraged by the quality of sPower’s people, operating assets and development pipeline
In fact, we are well positioned to capitalize on sPower’s 10-gigawatt-plus development pipeline by closing on at least 500 megawatts of solar projects annually in the U.S
Additionally, we have received a number of inbound indications of interest to partner on a portion of sPower’s operating assets
We’re evaluating these proposals, which would increase our overall returns and allow us to redeploy the capital into sPower’s attractive growth pipeline
Turning to Slide 9. In Brazil, during the quarter, Tietê moved forward on three growth transactions
Tietê closed the acquisition of the 386-megawatt Alto Sertão wind plant, finalized the acquisition of the 75-megawatt Boa Hora solar project and signed an agreement to acquire the 150-megawatt Bauru solar complex
The wind plant is currently operating with an 18-year contract, and all solar projects are expected to be operational in 2018 with 20-year regulated contracts
The BRL1.6 billion of capital needed to fund these 611 megawatts of renewable expansions in Brazil has been secured by tapping into the available debt capacity at Tietê without any equity
Returns on these long-term contracted assets are in the mid-teens in U.S
dollar terms
Finally, turning to Slide 10. In Mexico, we’re also seeing attractive returns for our development projects
With our partner, Grupo Bal, one of the largest business groups in Mexico, we have developed a strong 2.5-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and natural gas projects
We are targeting long-term bilateral contracts with creditworthy, large industrial off-takers
For example, we recently signed an agreement to acquire the 306 Mesa La Paz wind development project, which has a 25-year U.S
dollar-denominated PPA
The project site also has sufficient additional land to accommodate up to 200 megawatts of solar, which could be an attractive upside in the future
We expect to reach financial close early next year and begin construction of Mesa La Paz shortly thereafter
In summary, as you can see on Slide 11, we will be adding 8.4 gigawatts of new capacity by 2020. This includes almost 7 gigawatts of projects under construction or recently acquired
The remaining 1.5 gigawatts represent projects in advanced-stage development
As a result of these additions, our average remaining contract term will increase from 6 years currently to 10 years by 2020. We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contributions for both our projects under construction and the development projects I just discussed
The projects we have under construction and the more recent investments we have made are helping us to significantly reshape our portfolio to achieve our financial objectives
At the same time, we're reducing our carbon intensity and deploying tomorrow's technologies
As you can see on Slide 12, by the end of 2020, our coal generation will decline from 41% to 33%, while renewables and cash generation will increase from 55% to 63%
We've also been driving the adoption of energy storage in our markets as shown on Slide 13. We are a global leader in the industry with presence in seven markets, including 228 megawatts in operation and another 250 megawatts under contract or construction
In the Dominican Republic, we recently completed 20 megawatts of new energy storage
In September, these facilities performed flawlessly, working twice as much as normal to ensure the electric grid stayed online during Hurricanes Irma and Maria
We believe the integration of energy storage and renewables is key to accelerating a cleaner energy future
This is one of the most promising opportunities in our industry, and our businesses are leading the way
For example, in Hawaii, we're helping the island of Kauai reduce their reliance on diesel generators by delivering a 28-megawatt solar farm and a 20-megawatt, five-hour duration energy storage
Integrating energy storage to enhance the output of solar and wind facilities is a key focus area for Fluence, our new energy storage joint venture with Siemens
The Fluence JV received anti-trust approval from the European Commission in October and is expected to close by the end of this year
Once closed, we expect Fluence to deliver energy storage solution and services to a broader group of customers, from commercial and industrial companies to utilities and power developers in 160 countries
Together with Siemens, our goal is for Fluence to be the market leader in this high-growth segment that is expected to grow tenfold in five years, reaching at least 28 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2022. With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail
Thanks, Tom
In summary, we’re taking a lot of actions at AES to deliver on our strategy and commitments to shareholders
Our sector is undergoing significant change, and we’re undertaking a further transformation of our business to take advantage of new opportunities
Specifically, we’re accelerating and increasing our asset sales program to achieve $1 billion in proceeds by end 2018 and a total of $2 billion by 2020. We’re on track to achieve our target $400 million in annual cost savings and revenue enhancements, and we’re aggressively pursuing additional savings that we will announce on our fourth quarter call
We’re advancing on our 5 gigawatts of construction projects and are aiming to resolve the issues at Alto Maipo in the first quarter of 2018. We are pleased with our acquisition of sPower and see many attractive renewable opportunities across our portfolio
We expect Fluence to close this year, and our goal is to maintain our global leadership in a market that is projected to grow tenfold over the next five years
These actions will result in a simpler portfolio, earning higher risk-adjusted returns and a stronger balance sheet with improved credit metrics
Our overriding objective is to generate 8% to 10% average annual growth in earnings and free cash flow
When combined with our dividend, we expect to deliver a total shareholder return of at least 12% annually
Now we’ll be happy to take your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Hi, Ali
Yes, Ali, well, when we started, we were in 28 countries
When we exit the Philippines, we’ll be in 15. We’ve always said that somewhere between 12 to 15 countries is kind of our probably we thought that where we would end up
So I think it’s looking more like a dozen
And of course, we never announce anything before the sale is actually done
So some of it will be exiting some countries, and some of it will be selling down from certain assets
And in some cases, may be selling down a portion of the assets
For example, as we did recently in the Dominican Republic, to realize value
I think the important thing is that where we want to end up and what does that portfolio look like
And as we said, it will be simpler
It will be in less countries
It will be less carbon-intensive
And we will be, if you will, sort of turning capital into growth areas where we get higher returns and then sitting on some existing assets
Well, I will say – well, I think the lessons – I mean, we moved to get out of merchant generation, I think, on a timely basis
I think we’ve exited a number of markets that since I’ve been troubled on a timely basis, and I think we’ve generally sold our assets at very good prices
So we didn’t do really any sort of fire sales
We waited in some cases until the contracts ran out
Now if you look at our strategy, we’re moving into much more contract, and we’re lengthening our average contract versus what we have even today
So I think we have a quite different strategy from most
I think we’re changing our risk profile
We’ve significantly derisked
I’m sure you’ll notice that on this call, we did not talk about the weather in Brazil
That used to be the main focus of these calls, quite frankly
And we have been able to derisk from the way we’ve contracted
I think, as Tom mentioned, when we deconsolidate Eletropaulo, it will make a better correlation between really our economic, our financial profile and our consolidated profile
And lastly, we’re moving aggressively to become investment-grade
So I think on all these fronts, I think our strategy has been considerably different from other firms, which have remained less contracted and also, quite frankly, which aren’t moving into the newer technologies
So I think we have the advantage of being in more rapidly growth markets and being well-positioned
Having said that, ever since I’ve been CEO and Tom’s been CFO, I mean, we have looked at all alternatives, and we periodically have third parties come in and look and say is there any way we can sustainably add value to the company? So we’re always open to these any ideas, but we’re only going to do things which makes sense for the company in terms of a sustainable company
So we’re open to all alternatives
I’ve seen the – some of these
And obviously, in the sector, there’s been a lot of consolidation to take out costs, but we’ve taken a lot of costs
And we’re also, as we’ve said on this call, going to be aggressively looking at our cost structure
This is partly the result, I’d say, of the actions we’ve taken, the systems we’ve put in place and also the simplification of our portfolio
That’s a great question
When you remember, when YieldCo’s first started, it was a lot of, I’d say, questions we were getting from various people like, why don’t you do a YieldCo? And one of our concerns was not to have a – to be sort of committed to growth in case markets turned
And I think, in general, that has been the, right now, the right decision
Now if you look at what we’re doing today, we did mention, for example, that on sPower, we are looking at selling down a portion of the operating assets to enhance our returns and be able to move that money into new projects, the 10-gigawatt-plus pipeline where we think we can improve our average return
So in that sense, we, I think, have shown that we can access private money
We’ve raised about $3.8 billion over the last six years of partner equity, including – from the large Canadian pension funds
So in that sense, I think that our view is that we are very interested in coming up with ownership structures, which are win-wins, where we provide for people looking for long-term, stable, investment-grade assets
And at the same time, it allows us to reduce our participation and improve our returns be it through management fees or promote – or development fees
So that is part of the market
Now I think where we’re somewhat different is that we see the advantage of having a platform in these countries
So for example, having a strong partner in Mexico opens a lot of opportunities for us in renewables
Having a strong position in various markets opens that up
So we want to use our scale and in cases, integrate the new renewables with our existing assets because, obviously, energy prices from renewables, in many cases, are lower
But if you can integrate that with the capacity from existing assets, you can have some very interesting propositions for your customers
In the longer term, we think batteries can supply that in many markets
But right now, we see that opportunity
So to answer your question, we have approached the problem from a sort of customer-centric position
We’re taking advantage of our platforms, and we’re bringing in capital and selling down when we see the opportunity that, that would improve our returns
Well, I think, again, if you think of something like sPower, we have a partnership with them
sPower, as we’ve said in the past regarding acquisitions, we would look opportunistically at that
If we think that there are acquisitions where we have significant synergies, it’s 2 plus 2 equals 6, add to that portfolio
On the other hand, we’re not looking right now at sort of big acquisitions, et cetera
We’re sort of looking at asset acquisitions that could enhance that portfolio
And as I said, if there are interested parties in taking a portion of that from the sPower JV, that’s fine as well
I think this is a – the negotiations in Alto Maipo are proceeding
The Alto Maipo team and Gener team are doing a great job
I would say that Gener will remain an investment-grade company, that any equity contributions from Gener to the Alto Maipo project would maintain that investment grade, will be very – looking at the sort of marginal returns of that investment
And we don't expect it to significantly affect any dividend distributions from Gener into the future
So those are the things
Now we've also said that should we decide not to proceed with the project, that would also, in terms of the cash distributions from Gener, those would continue, although they might take a different form in terms of like return of capital
So we're looking at both
We will be very disciplined
On the other hand, we think that there is a win-win solution here, which would be good for all parties, including, obviously, Chile and Chile electric system from completing the project
I mean, you know that when we first announced that we'd be doing asset sales, I believe we used a number of around $1 billion
I think we're at $4 billion now
We announced Cal's, as we've said, $100 million
We're at $200-million-plus now
So generally, we just want to be, as Tom was saying, have a real clear line of sight
Now obviously, we have a number of opportunities that would make sense from a strategic plan that I outlined that we think can easily get us to that $2 billion number by 2020.
Yes
And what I'd say is we are – our overriding objective is to meet that 8% to 10% growth rate we've committed
So there will be puts and takes, like Tom said, but it won't affect us reaching our objectives
No, not specifically
We just – it's something we're evaluating, and we'll talk more about it on our year-end call in Feb
Good morning
What I'd say as a summary, the additional cost cuts that we're working on and will announce in the fourth quarter will give us additional comfort of hitting that range
So this is – it's additional to what the cost cuts we've announced in the past
On the other hand, we're not changing that guidance range
It will give us additional comfort
Because as we – as Tom said, there's puts and takes, so we want to make sure that we hit our numbers
Well, we have done a considerable amount of buyback over the years, and we do have an outstanding approval
So we're not saying that we're – won't do buybacks
We're just not announcing any specific buybacks at this point in time
So obviously, we are not happy at all with where our stock is trading, and we always consider that
But I think that at this point, we're undergoing a transition program, and I think it will be very important that we deliver on our numbers
But certainly, we're not saying that we won't do stock buybacks
Currently, we have $250 million still remaining on our prior authorization
Point taken, Greg
As I said, we've – today, we're returning through the dividend about 55% of our parent free cash flow
So I think we remain committed to giving money back to our shareholders, and we have done, I believe it's about $1.5 billion of stock buybacks, at least over the past five years
So I certainly don't want to say that this is off the table, and point taken
Masinloc 2 is under construction
The construction is going well, and that would be part of
Well, we would finish the construction under our contract for the new seller
I’d say, first to say that Argentina has really made a comeback
I think, starting from the top level as the – politically, as you know, they had a recently elections for Congress, and Macri’s party got 40% of the vote, much more than people had expected
So the reforms are going forward in Argentina
In our sector, they’ve made very important reforms: one is dollarizing; second is increasing moderately, prices – retail prices but also generation
And they will move towards a liberated market
People forget, but in the 1990s, Argentina had one of the best regulations on the planet in terms of liberated markets
So Argentina is doing much, much better
Our business is doing much, much better
We had two years where we did not receive dividends from Argentina, even though the business has always made money
So it’s obviously, we perceive much more dividends and making much more money
Getting to your point about this was the FONINVEMEM, one of the more difficult acronyms we have to pronounce
They have been paying the interest on the FONINVEMEM
These are actualized
Part of the bonds are tied to the completion of actual generation assets
In this case, it was the Guillermo Brown as being the largest one
So that plant is up and running
So that whole – and what I would put it was basically part that the CAMMESA would take part of your payments and essentially give you these bonds and use the funds to build a new asset
But they have paid interest
The plants have been completed, so that – that’s going well
No, because of the contract we have
I mean, I think that when you speak about it, it would – what I think is interesting is that with energy storage, we’re seeing that regulations
And they have a lot of – they do a lot of things, which aren’t translated in the current regulation
All over the world, what we’re doing is, let’s say, testing and actually, certifying some of our coal plants to run at lower MINs [ph] to give them greater flexibility to be ready for that future
But I don’t know, Tom, do you want to add anything?
