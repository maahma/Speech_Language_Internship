Thank you, Mark, and good morning everyone
Let me just begin by extending my sincere thanks and enormous congratulations to Carol Roberts, who is sitting here beside me as she used closure of this chapter of her professional life and [indiscernible]
And as I know I can speak to so many of you here in the room and across the company, as well as many on the line today, you have a made a different for International Paper have positively impacted so many of our senior leadership support
So Carol, all the best
Now, back to business
I’m on Slide 9, which is about full year operating EPS Bridge from 2015 to 2016. As Mark already shared year-over-year earnings were impacted by price erosion and weaker mix across many of our businesses this past year, driving a $0.70 unfavorable swing versus 2015 levels
Biggest movers were containerboard for export, global pulp and boxes in the North America, which decline modestly for the first three quarters of the year largely precipitated by the January 2015 index increase, all prior to our implementation of our October box price increases late in the fourth quarter
Volume of the net positive for the year, primarily function of improving North American box demand
Operation quite solid and improving performance across our mill system we’re drag on earning in the year have been impacted by several items including our Riegelwood fluff pulp conversion to ramp up, Hurricane Matthew and a significant non-cash LIFO inventory reevaluation associated with our October containerboard increase implementation
And while lower input costs were tailwind for much of the year driving a net positive, we saw meaningful shift in that trend over the last few months of 2016 as many inputs began to turn high we’ll get more into that later in the call as we speak to the outlook
So moving across the bridge, a lower effective tax rate and interest expense combined for a dime of improvement and Ilim contributed to the positive largely driven by FX
And lastly earnings associated with our acquisition of Weyerhaeuser’s pulp business in the month of December at $0.03 to the year
Now turning to Slide 10, International Paper delivered solid results in the fourth quarter supported by increasing box demand and higher prices of containerboard and boxes in our North American Industrial Packaging business
This all against the backdrop though of fallen pulp prices and rising input costs primarily OCC and energy
On the operations of cost front c,ontinued solid mill performance was unfavorably impacted by seasonality and where I mean by that is higher consumption of energy in raw materials associated with colder temperatures
As well as a handful of non-repeating items including the impact of Hurricane Matthew, our year-end LIFO inventory reevaluation, as I mentioned in the previous slide, and as well as higher expenses related medical claims in the quarter
All of which if you remember from our third quarter call, we’re expected in part of our outlook
Further, the Ilim JV delivered another strong quarter of results with operational EBITDA of $180 million
And strategically, we close the acquisition of Weyerhaeuser’s pulp business marking the beginning of our newly combined Global Cellulose Fibers business segment of which the integration is opt to a great start and we’re delighted to welcome 2,000 new colleagues to the IP team creating the preeminent Global Cellulose Fibers business in dynamic and growing space, the long runway of value creation so more to come on now
The quarter-over-quarter bridge on Slide 11, depicts what I just said, higher prices for containerboard and boxes in North America Industrial Packaging were offset by lower prices – lower pulp prices and IP’s legacy pulp business
And despite four fewer shipping days for North America box shipments, volume was flat sequentially due to a higher daily demand for boxes of 5% in the quarter, which was really meaningful
Operations and other costs were down $0.18 quarter-over-quarter, about a half of which was due to seasonality mainly higher energy consumption and the other half due to non-repeating items as I described on the previous slide
If this were a headwind and OCC continue to escalate as we expecting the quarter
Turning to the businesses, and starting with industrial packaging on Slide 12, initial benefits of the price increase were realized as expected in the quarter
Domestic containerboard increase was fully implemented up to the $40 index moved and North America box prices were up $4 per ton on average quarter-over-quarter
Volume was strong but higher containerboard exports and the better and expected daily box demand rate only partially offset the impact of four fewer shipping days though
In operations and other costs are largest business that the blunt of the previously mentioned non-repeating items and input costs were higher with OCC accounting for half of the total impact with an increasing trend driving a higher exit rate than average in the quarter
The next Slide on 13 is intended to provide some additional color on how we are thinking about 2017 full year benefits associated with the October 2016 domestic containerboard and price increase
Starting with the upper left hand portion of slide, you can see that IP has roughly 10 million tons that are within the scope of this announced increase
9 million tons of U.S
integrated box business and about 1 million tons of domestic containerboard sales
So the simple math here, given the $40 expectation I referenced earlier, is about $400 million annualized
While we expect to realize $400 million in absolute terms, there are several factors to consider relative to the year-over-year earnings impact
Moving your attention to the graph on the top right, and factoring initial benefits we saw in the fourth quarter, year-over-year exit rate U.S
box prices remain below fourth quarter 2015 levels
As we report quarterly in the appendix, North American box prices on average are down $18 per ton versus the fourth quarter 2015. Largely due to the impacts related to the $15 per ton index reset in early 2015 and normal erosion we see prior to our October increase
So, roughly half of the expected increase benefit essentially goes to price restoration and, considering the rising OCC cost escalation trend, another material portion of the increase just covers this headwind
All that said, the increase execution is moving along smoothly and we expect full implementation by the end of the first quarter
Okay, now on Slide 14, I’d like to turn to our newly combined business, Global Cellulose Fibers, which beginning with this fourth quarter release will be reported on a standalone business segment
As you can see on the map the combined business has a solid fleet of mills strategically positioned across the southeast U.S
along with a couple of specialized processing facilities in Mississippi and Poland
In addition we have acquired a highly capable and competitive northern softwood craft mill in Alberta, Canada
So in total, IP’s Global Cellulose Fibers business has a combined 3.6 million tons of capacity for softwood and fluff pulp, as well as other specialties applications and is extremely well positioned to serve our global customers in these attractive and growing segments
Looking forward, given our current fixed utilization depicted in the pie chart in the top right, there are significant product mix upgrade opportunities to fluff and our specialty products, as well as installed incremental fluff capacity post our Riegelwood conversion to grow with our customers’ increasing demand
So, with this exciting combination, IP could not be better positioned to take advantage of this very attractive global markets
On Slide 15, just as some background, I’m taking a closer look at global fluff pulp markets, we have a nice mix of both established and higher growth emerging markets geographically and a wide range of products with different levels of maturity in the marketplace
So for example, North America and Western Europe continue to grow in line with expecting population trends while emerging markets like Asia, Latin America and the Middle East will drive most of the growth rate expected to be 4%
Primary applications for fluff pulp are spread between baby diapers, feminine hygiene and adult incontinence products and with our additional capabilities of the Weyerhaeuser system, we have the technical and human resources, as well as the manufacturing capacity, to drive innovation and product development in to other high value specialties in the pulp space that will provide further growth opportunities beyond those reflected here
Okay, turning to Slide 16, and taking a look at our pro forma results for the combined business, there was a significant reduction in earnings from 2015 to 2016. This was primarily due to two factors
One was the costs associated with the Riegelwood conversion and ramp-up in our Legacy business, which amounted to roughly $80 million in 2016. The other is price and mix erosion which was experienced evenly across both Legacy businesses as both softwood and fluff prices came under pressure in 2016. Further, IP saw the negative mix impact associated with Riegelwood capacity which ramped up our market softwood pulp in the second half of 2016 as we were working toward fluff qualification with our customers
So a negative mix effect there
The outlook for 2017 is a mix of both favorable and timing related unfavorable items with a slants to positive
To the upside we have expected demand growth, the synergy opportunities, and our recently announced price increases for softwood and fluff pulp products
But, clearly exit rate prices for 2016 were lower than average prices for the year and the large extended average in capital investment project underway at the Port Wentworth mill had a significant cost impact in the quarter
With that said, this large project to upgrade the recovery boiler, turbine and power system at the mill has attractive energy savings benefits and we’ll enjoy those, following completion, for years to come
On 17, back to the integration, you can see the synergy opportunity and associated timeline for realization of the newly combined businesses
There are three major buckets of synergies, overhead, commercial mix improvement, which are both fluff and specialty opportunities, and a large bucket of manufacturing, supply chain and sourcing opportunities that we will leverage
Looking at the chart on the right, you can see the expected ramp-up and run rate targets for year end 2017 and 2018. We expect a run rate of $100 million in synergies by the end of this year adding approximately $50 million to earnings for 2017. One-time costs will be treated as special items and are expected to be around $85 million of which about half were expense from December and the balance will be spread over this year and next, all will be treated as special items as I just said
Related to synergies, we know how to do this
The teams are off an running, have line of sight to the target and we’ll work hard to exceed expectations
Turning now to the consumer packaging business on Slide 18. We had a light quarter as we saw continued price pressure in elements of the folding carton segment and on plate stock along with seasonally lower volume
Operations were as expected, but costs were higher due to seasonality
Planned maintenance averages were also higher given the plan [indiscernible] average
Now moving to Printing Papers, Slide 19. As we said earlier, given the new Cellulose Fibers segment, reporting for paper beginning this quarter will no longer include pulp
In terms of results, price mix was impacted primarily by higher export sales out of North America
However we experienced good volume mainly due seasonally stronger volume in Brazil
Operations and costs were negatively impacted by a challenging operational quarter at a couple of our European mills, Hurricane Matthew in North America, and seasonably higher operating costs and higher medical claims in the quarter that I mentioned earlier
Planned maintenance outage expenses were higher in the quarter and we experienced some unfavorable FX impacts in Brazil due to the strengthening house
Now moving to Ilim on Slide 20, the JV had another strong quarter capped off what we consider a great year
All three mills set production records for both periods, the quarter and the year, and strong demand primarily in China led to higher sales volume in the fourth quarter with total volume up a little over 5% for the full year
Looking to the first quarter, JV expects modest pulp price improvement to be more than offset by normal seasonality, resulting in lower sales volume and higher input costs primarily wood
Additionally, the board of directors at the JV has authorized a cash dividend to be distributed in March of which IP will receive $100 million
Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 21, IP experienced a step up in leverage ratios in 2016 as you can see, primarily due to increased debt taken to facilitate the pulp business acquisition but also impacted lower EBITDA performance
Our pension gap decreased by $200 million as we made voluntary contributions totaling $750 million in the year, some of which was offset by a 30 basis point decline in discount rate by the end of the year
However, the discount rate did improve significantly in the fourth quarter as we exited the year versus prior quarter trend, so really better than it could have been
The additional debt taken on this year largely to fund the acquisition, was done [indiscernible] tranches at an average interest rate of 0.7%
Our plan as we work to pay down debt to restore leverage ratios in line with our target within the next two years will be to take out new debt
Okay, matrix and before I speak to the specifics regarding outlook for the first quarter, I’d note that given the evolving situation at Pensacola, our matrix does not reflect any of the impacts associated with the mill interruption but I will speak more to that following this slide
So back on Slide 22, starting with price and specifically we expect to see significant benefits from implementation of the North America price increase in both domestic containerboard and U.S
box in the range of about $70 million
For volume, additional shipping days in North America will be largely offset by a lower daily shipping rate and we expect earnings from the additional volume from the first full quarter of the acquisition in Cellulose Fibers to also be offset by normal seasonal decline in Brazil, so net-net, flattish in this volume bucket
Within operations and costs, the non-repeats of the impact from the one-off items from the fourth quarter, remember the hurricane, LIFO, and medical claims, are expected to be a benefit of $30 million for packaging and $20 million for papers in the coming quarter
So the red that jumps off the page are our plans – our underlined plans, maintenance outage expenses in the quarter, which would be $102 million higher sequentially, so really just timing along with the addition of outages associated with our expanded Cellulose Fibers business
Input costs are expected to increase primarily across North American operations by $40 million versus the fourth quarter driven largely by OCC and natural gas
And finally, relative of a couple of the items in the other categories, we’re expecting a higher tax rate in Q1 around 33%, so back to a more normalized level
And results at the Ilim JV are expected to be lower primarily due to seasonally lower volume and seasonally higher input costs
So, turning to Slide 23, let me provide a brief update on the Pensacola mills digester incident which occurred on the evening of Sunday, January 22, and for those of you not familiar with the digester, it’s a large pressurized vessel that cooks wood chips, turning wood chips in to un-bleached Cellulose Fiber
And relative to this incident, the vessel – the digester vessel failed, causing separation of its top and associated damage to the adjacent powerhouse due to flying debris
At the instant of the failure, the pressurized content within the digester, primarily raw pulp, water, and pulping mister, were released to the surrounding areas
Thankfully not a single person at the mill was injured
And of course, our immediate response was to ensure the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and neighbors, in and around the site
We accomplished this and shortly after, the following day, a unified command was formed including representatives from the Escambia County Health Department, the Florida Department Environmental Protection, the U.S
Environmental Protection Agency, as well as International Paper
The unified command took full control and led the development and execution of plans to clean the impacted areas and to address community concerns
At this point, we have already made significant progress on the cleanup and will not stop until the area is restored
In terms of our progress towards bringing the mill back to an a operating state, earlier this week we restarted the powerhouse and resumed partial operations of the pulp line, which is supported by a different set of smaller batch digesters
Today we continue to ramp up production of fluff pulp and expect to be fully online by the weekend
Relative to containerboard though, repairing the damage continuous digester will take some time
And while we’re working toward a firm estimate, what we do know now is that startup will not take place in the first quarter
So, we’ll continue to use our extensive containerboard mill network to meet customer needs over the next several weeks
As you can appreciate, just 10 days post the incident, it is difficult to estimate the full financial impact, as well as the timeline associated with this situation
With that said, we know there will be major costs incurred
In this quarter and beyond and at this point we expect the total impact to be in excess of $50 million
This will not be a special item
But we do have property damage and business interruption insurance that we expect will cover a significant portion of the costs
Relative to our insurance, we will have a deductible up to $20 million which you can say, essentially, that’s a cap on our exposure
With that said, timing of the insurance recovery will be uneven and there will likely be some lag associated with getting our claims covered
Net-net we see this all trued up by year end
Finally, the changer digester, which was the primary equipment impacted, is fully depreciated so no write-off will come with at least this primary piece of equipment
So, given the evolving nature of the situation, we commit and plan to provide a more specific estimate of timing and costs publicly before the end of the quarter, so more to come on this
Lastly on Slide 24, here we have some of the key financial metrics we normally provide to build a picture of our planning assumptions for 2017. CapEx will be higher at around $1.5 billion which includes the expanded Cellulose Fibers business, approximately $100 million of the delta, as well as the mill conversion in Madrid
We expect 2017 depreciation also to be up to roughly $1.4 billion including $140 million of depreciation carried over from the recently acquired pulp assets
Interest expense is impacted by our hard debt profile and corporate items and our effective tax rate will stay within normalized levels into 2017 based on what we know today
Also given the escalating input cost backdrop, we have included our current view relative to this impact year-over-year in the range of about $180 million to $200 million higher in 2017. And as this item we see this as directional only as we note that there’s more likely incremental risk as many of these items are already looking to be pushing the upper end of the range
So with that, I will turn it back over to Mark
Again that that $50 million is an estimate and that’s a greater than $50 million, but to your question, Mark, this is Glenn, yes, business interruption, lost sales, mix, freight all those factors would be covered by insurance after the deductible
Yeah, this is Glenn Landau
Certainly, the rain has helped
There were some pretty easy comps though
So you have to keep that in mind, but we saw a strong performance in our agricultural segment in the fourth quarter
No reason to believe that it won’t be strong in 2017. Just from a segment standpoint, we also saw process foods recovering
Our fourth quarter was pretty good on that front
Protein, which after coming of a couple years of issued that various segments approaching were working through
We saw the beginnings of recovery there as well
And so we’re in the midst of updating models for 2017. I think everything we’ve seen so far were still kind of in the 1%, 1.5% range and really haven’t seen anything that would make us think it’s going to be less than that
Hey, Mark, this is Glenn
Yes, the fourth quarter is seasonally the strongest quarter for Brazilian paper
What happens there is essentially that’s the build for the new school year that starts in the southern hemisphere and essentially in late January after Carnival
So, it’s a build for that demand pull
Net, net though it was just seasonal demand while we saw some signs of growth in the third quarter, this is going to be a slow recovery in Brazil
We’re not seeing or feeling incremental demand associated with recovery at this point and I think that applies as well to packaging
So at this point in time steady, not going backwards, but no real economic driven demand growth
Yes, it is
That’s our target actually
Well, Chip, as you know, we’ll keep all our options open, but we do not have any required pension contributions in either one of the years you’ve referenced, but not this year or next
