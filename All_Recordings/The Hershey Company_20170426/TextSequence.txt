Thanks, Mark, and good morning to all of you on the phone and webcast
Hershey's first quarter results were solid and I'm pleased with our performance
Net sales growth was 2.8%, delivering our fourth consecutive quarter of at least 2% sales growth, which we're happy with, given the choppy food industry retail trends in the U.S
and the macroeconomic challenges in some international markets
Gross margin was up nicely in Q1 and is expected to increase for the full year, fueling higher levels of advertising and other brand building initiatives
Adjusted EPS was $1.31, a strong start to the year and puts us in a position to deliver on our commitments
The Margin for Growth Program we discussed on March 1st is on track
This will not be a big benefit to our 2017 results
However, this multiyear program should enable us to achieve strong margin and EPS growth in 2018 and 2019 and provide us with the fuel to deliver consistent annual net sales and EPS growth post implementation
Preliminary analysis of Easter data indicates that we had a good season with sell-through in line with estimates, putting us in a position to gain share in this important season
We believe this will result in total Hershey U.S
candy, mint and gum, or CMG, April year-to-date retail takeaway of about 2.5%
While we don't like getting ahead of ourselves before results are final, given the timing of Easter, we thought this was an important metric to share
retail takeaway for the 12 weeks ending April 8, 2017, in the xAOC+C-store channels declined 7.9%
As we stated on last quarter's conference call, first quarter net sales would be greater than retail takeaway due to Easter timing
Recall that Easter occurred on April 16th in 2017 compared to March 27th in 2016. Perhaps the easiest way to assess performance given seasonal timing, and therefore, noise in the data, is by looking at absolute market share results
In the first quarter, we gained market share, both with and without the Easter seasonal activity
In total, including the headwind from the year-ago seasonal activity, Hershey U.S
CMG market share increased plus 0.4 points
Our core power brands, Reese's, Hershey's, Kit Kat, Kisses and Ice Breakers, which had 2016 retail sales of $5 billion, continue to perform well
In the first quarter, combined non-seasonal retail takeaway on these brands increased 5.6%
Our Reese's NCAA basketball program and the launch of Hershey's Cookie Layer Crunch, or CLC, helped drive results
While we're pleased with our first quarter market share gains, non-seasonal CMG retail takeaway was softer than we anticipated, resulting in Q1 net sales coming in less than our plan
As you are all aware, Q1 marketplace performance across most of the U.S
food group was soft
While the perimeter continues to grow faster than center of the store, its growth rate also slowed
Our analysis points to several factors contributing to the softness
Some of them appeared to be Q1-specific, such as the tax refund delay while others are a continuation of the challenges like benefits inflation or channel shifting that we've been living with and we continue to solve for
Additionally, retail trips within xAOC+C-store channels was about the same as the year-ago period, although dollars per trip were down
Dollars per trip were better in March
And as I mentioned earlier, preliminary Easter sell-through is in line with our estimates
We have a lot of variety, innovation and in-store programming over the remainder of the year as well as higher levels of advertising
We think categories within the snack wheel will outpace center of the store products given the impulsivity and percentage of merchandising and display allocated to snacks
As a result, we expect Hershey non-seasonal U.S
CMG marketplace trends to improve
However, given the uncertainty regarding overall U.S
brick-and-mortar retail trends, our updated full year U.S
net sales growth rate is lower than our previous forecast
Looking at some of our 2017 activity, it starts with Hershey's CLC, which has gotten off to a good start
In the first quarter, CLC net sales and marketplace results were in line with our estimates
Internally, we refer to CLC as a vertical launch, as our goal was to attain 80% distribution by early February
We achieved this in eight weeks and had product available in all major channels to coincide with the beginning of TV and digital advertising
The take-home stand-up pouch is doing very well followed by the king-size pack-type
Sales by class of trade are tracking as expected
C-store results are particularly strong with retail sales two times that of any other channel
While early, repeat purchases are tracking nicely
Although retail sales trends did slow in April given the Easter period as there's not a seasonal pack-type or packaging for this product yet
With the launch of Reese's and Hershey's Cookies 'n' Crème Crunchers, we are looking to expand our power brands to capture broader snacking occasions
Our research continues to show that snacking occasions have increased throughout the day
The modern snacking model indicates 90% of consumers snack multiple times throughout the day
We expect that Crunchers will capture a portion of these snacking occasions as it combines powerful growing brands with sweet and crunchy textures to deliver a light, crisp eating experience
The take-home stand-up bag is currently available at a few select retailers, and the instant consumable tubes will be available by the end of June
We have a strong integrated Crunchers marketing plan to build awareness and trial, including a national FSI in Q3, in-store merchandising and display, as well as advertising
I'm also excited about the late Q2 launch of Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup
The excitement of this launch started in February when the Reese's brand team started using social media to engage consumer with clues to a new chocolaty Cupspiracy
The team posted various graphics and videos to hype the followers; and in March, announced the upcoming launch of the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Cup, a peanut butter cup infused with crunchy pieces from a chocolate cookie
This product, only available in an instant consumable pack-type, begins to ship in Q2. And I think you'll find that the crunchy cookie bits are a complementary texture with the peanut butter that makes it a very satisfying experience
Additionally, our Reese's Snack Mix and Hershey's Snack Bites products continue to do well, and we're leveraging some other equities as well such as ALMOND JOY and TAKE5. These items have enabled us to expand our breadth across the snack wheel and capture new usage occasions
That was just a brief summary of some of the activity we have in North America that we believe will grow our business over the remainder of the year
We feel that our brand support, innovation, consumer spending and investment and go-to-market capabilities will enable us to deliver our full year net sales objective
Snacks, which confectionery is a large part of, is performing better than many of the center of store categories, and we expect that to be the case going forward
Investments in the CMG category in the form of advertising and innovation are present from most major manufacturers
Therefore, given the high household penetration and the impulsive nature of the category, as well as affordable price points and solid margins, retailers continue to value the confectionery category
As a result, we would expect the category to continue to secure key merchandising and programming space
Now, for an update on our International and Other segment
Net sales were essentially in line with our plan and on a constant currency basis up 4.2% versus the first quarter of 2016. I was particularly pleased with Mexico, Brazil, and India, where constant currency first quarter net sales increased a combined 15%
In Mexico, our chocolate retail takeaway increased solid double digits, although slightly less than the category growth of about 15%
Constant currency net sales increased 13%, driven by a combination of volume and pricing
Sales were strong across all categories and brands, particularly Kisses and Hershey's chocolates, Hershey's milk drink box, and Pelon Pelo Rico
Our new Hershey's CHOCOYOGO and Hershey's milk sticks are resonating with consumers and gaining traction
In Brazil, while preliminary, we estimate that the chocolate category increased 7% to 8%
Our retail takeaway in Brazil was about two-and-a-half times the category growth rate, fueled by distribution gains on core brands and the continued rollout of the Hershey's Special Milk and Hershey's Special Dark Bars, which were launched in the second half of 2016. As a result, in Q1, our market share in Brazil increased 0.6 points to about 4.5%
Constant currency net sales in India increased about 16%
Growth in the brands we're investing behind Hershey's branded syrup, spreads, and milk booster as well as Brookside, JOLLY RANCHER and SOFIT increased more than 50%
The launch of Brookside, primarily in the modern trade, is progressing and on plan
While small, this launch gives us exposure to a segment with above-average gross margin for the India business
Importantly, the transition of the portfolio is enabling a higher-margin business, which should put us in a position to invest and win in the marketplace with a sustainable operating model
As we end the second quarter in China, we'll begin to implement the Margin for Growth Program we discussed earlier this year
The program includes an initiative to optimize the manufacturing operations supporting our China business
Patricia will discuss and review the impact of our impairment test of China's long-lived assets
But the overall goal of this program is clear and will focus on improving global efficiency and effectiveness, optimizing the company's supply chain and streamlining the operating model
China chocolate category sales in Q1 were about flat versus a year ago, and better than our estimate
This was similar to trends of other impulse products, which declined
Given the typical inventory levels we had post-Chinese New Year and the soft category in March, the temporary plant closure of about three weeks to four weeks due to an unscheduled inspection by regulators did not have a big impact on our business
Our chocolate business in China underperformed the market in the first quarter, with market share off one point
As we right-size our business and portfolio over the next year or two, we're looking to prioritize cities, classes of trade, brands, and innovation to satisfy the needs of this dynamic market
We're working closely with our local team, including our e-commerce group, which continues to show promise
Now to wrap up, I'm excited about our future, and I believe The Hershey Company has a long runway ahead of it
I'm supported by a great team of leaders, who have a lot of broad-based CPG experience
As we've shared with you on March 1st, we know what we need to do to succeed
We are executing on our model to expand margins by reallocating resources to initiatives with a higher rate of return
We're investing in capabilities like go-to-market and building on our intellectual capital while also leveraging our core power brands and equipping our organization with the resources and tools to win in the marketplace
These investments in growth and capabilities should put us in an advantage position to win with retailers and consumers, and ultimately, deliver on our financial commitments on our strategy of balanced top and bottom line growth and build shareholder value
I'll now turn it over to Patricia, who will provide you with details on our financial results
Patricia, do you want to handle that one?
Absolutely
So as you know, we work closely with all of our retail customer partners
And I think we mentioned last July that we were partnering with CVS on some of the work that they were doing around evolving their store layouts
And we partner with all of our retailers along those lines
And March 1st, we mentioned a different customer we're also working with those efforts on
I guess how I would tell you to think about it is, we service a broad range of retail customers
They all have very different strategies
And as some of our customer partners are making certain decisions on portfolio regarding store layout or front end, we have other of our customer partners who are actually looking to add incremental space behind confection, who are looking to take some other non-durable goods off the front end and put increased consumables and edibles; either overall at the front of store or as they have built their self checkouts and they hadn't yet built impulse around those
So we feel good about the growth we're seeing in the marketplace in indulgent categories
And if you look at the growth in categories, in indulgence and better-for-you, we're seeing growth across both and we have several customers who are really looking to leverage that growth
Good morning, David
Thanks, David
No, I would say two things
First of all, if you think about year-to-date, a large part of the acceleration of growth was driven by Easter
So, Easter is a big piece of what you see year-to-date
At the same time, we really look at the impact of the slowdown that we saw in the total box in Q1. And we saw that have an impact on everyday
So as we look at the balance of the year, we are looking for our everyday business to accelerate
And we believe that that takes to make for the back half of the year is very achievable
We'll be looking at ensuring we have adequate investments
So we'll actually have some higher levels of spending in the back part of the year to drive that acceleration in the form of advertising
And we feel good about that
But a lot of it is that Easter, the big boost in Easter and we really are looking and calling for an acceleration of everyday as we go into the back part of the year
If you – without getting in too many specifics, if you think about that year-to-date performance, you would see seasonal items grew about double digits
So think about that in that double-digit range
And if you look at our non-seasonal core power brands, kind of the biggest five brands, they were up mid-single digits
So, obviously, there was a little bit of softness across some of the non-core piece of our portfolio
But really double-digit growth on seasonal is what's a big component of 2.5%
Yes, that's right
So in the first quarter, trade was down as we lapped some incremental trade merchandising that we had shared with you last year
We made some big investments in incremental trade
And as we have constantly worked to optimize our blend across trade and advertising, we made some different decisions this year
And yes, our advertising expense was closer to flat in Q1. And as we go out to the balance of the year, we'll see increases
Good morning, Andrew
So, we have continued to see some very strong growth on barkTHINS as we are still in the process of driving against expanding distribution and gaining trial amongst consumers on that franchise
So, I would say given the big piece of the growth curve that we're on, on that business; we've continued to see very strong growth there
And I think we mentioned that it was a pretty significant piece of growth for us in Q1. And as I look at KRAVE, we're continuing to feel good about the momentum that we are seeing there
So we've continued to gain share
We feel good about where velocities are
Like any new brand, we're learning in terms of really optimizing how we make sure that we drive that hardest in the right – to the right consumers and into the right channels
So, in some cases, we overextended distribution, and we've right-sized that a bit
But we continued to see very nice growth there
So – yeah
Our consumption and retail takeaway does not have to be at 2.5 points
So we're actually planning for the takes to make there to be less than that, closer to slightly below 2 points
Yeah, exactly
In line with the takes to make on that sales end
And we anticipate that generally, our net sales and our takeaway are directionally pretty in line
So you're right that we had a big benefit in shipments in Q4 behind Cookie Layer Crunch
But as we look out to the back half of the year, across all the quarters, we think that we'll be relatively in line, plus or minus in that 0.5 point range
Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Got you
Thank you
Yeah
That's a great question
I mean, obviously, we can't speak directly to pricing or any kind of foreshadowing around the pricing piece
But I would say that we think about all of those as very viable levers and probably even more so today than we did in the past
So I think you're right that price mix is something we aggressively have our teams focused on, which we can drive through, focus on pack-types, focus on channels, build it into the innovation
And I think perhaps that's a lever that we have not used as aggressively in the past
We've spoken to you before about our whole focus on strategic revenue growth management and a lot of that as well is about really maximizing that net price realization by really, really scrutinizing all of the investments we make in trade and getting the value equation right on every pack-type and brand
So, we're putting more focus there than we have in the past
Well, I guess I'd say if I think about the first part of the year, I'd look and say Easter drove a lot of sales
And there is some sourcing from Easter across the base portfolio
So, I think it's hard to look just at the everyday business trends because there's interaction there with Easter
Certainly, I feel good about the fact that we have increased consumer investment as we go into the rest of the year, because we know that our category is very responsive
We continue to get very strong lift, and I feel really good that that combined with the very strong innovation that we have this year and customers are very excited about consumers are – are really going to help to drive consumers to the category and really boost the everyday business
So I would say, Pablo, we continue to see, if you at look category growth of various snack categories across the store that there is strong growth
There's growth in indulgence and there's also growth in health and wellness
So I don't know that I see a greater acceleration
We always start with the consumer in mind
And we are delighted to delight consumers with our indulgent portfolio
At the same time, we've been a leader in choice and transparency, and we always want to provide options to consumers
Now our Hershey's Kiss was one of the first forms of portion control at 25 calories for a Kiss
We led the smart labeling initiative in the industry
So we are just constantly evolving and updating our portfolio to help to meet consumer needs as best possible
Good morning
Yes, it was
It was consistent with the total box
If you look at every category in the box, the trend was the same across the board
And as we mentioned in the comments, we think that there – I think everybody's been looking to say, okay, what was that factor that really drove that across the board, and common thinking tends to be the tax refund delay had a big impact
There were some lapping issues on a year-to-year basis
And then there's some continued pressures
But we feel good that we still see a rebound in March really
And we are focused on watching that very closely going forward
And dollars per trip were actually up in March after having been down
We have started to see that rebound and agree with that
Nothing that we saw there at all
Thanks for the question
Yeah, we continue to feel really good with the programs that we have on the core brands
And so I think in terms of the continuing the growth on something like Reese's, it is continuing the news
And some of our incremental investments in advertising towards the back part of the year will be made against those core brands to continue to leverage the momentum
And then at the same time, we are absolutely focused on turning around and accelerating our growth trajectory on some of the other pieces of portfolio, namely on the non-chocolate sweets area
So we will be increasing our investment there
Although at the same time, we've right-sized those brands a bit
So as Mark mentioned, SKU rationalization, there are some areas where we have extended those brands and we had items in the marketplace that just weren't productive or profitable
And so we made a decision to take the hit on pulling back on some of that
But we do have teams very focused on accelerating the growth there
And I think that's an opportunity for us going forward
I don't really think it's not as well-positioned
I would say, I think that we have opportunities to just fix our execution on that piece of the portfolio
There was a little bit more competition from smaller players last year where they went really aggressively on price
Some of the things that we weren't willing to do given our focus on margin
So I really think it's more about what we do versus that there's any kind of consumer trend issue there
So, let me start, and then I'll transfer it over to Patricia
There is almost no – there is no shipment impact from that timing of Easter
I mean, we shipped almost nothing in terms of Easter into the second quarter
So that's not an issue at all
And relative to the write-offs, we feel great about Malaysia
So the write-offs that we talked about are not at all related to Malaysia
Okay
Yeah
We still feel good that we're in positive territory
Yeah, the quarters always come in a little bit different depending on the promotion and innovation calendar
But there's nothing that we'd be fallen off that kind of a cliff in the second quarter
Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Got it
So as part of our Margin for Growth and Margin Expansion Program, we've started immediately in terms of taking the necessary steps to reset our investment in that marketplace and make some of the tough decisions
At the same time, the local teams have built very focused plans in terms of where we are focusing to grow and build a sustainable business model
So we are focused on multiyear program
But beginning now to really focus on a couple of key provinces on our core portfolio and on a profitable mix of brands across the portfolio
As you all know, the cost structure in some of the channels in China have changed and so we are shifting to more profitable channels and really try to capture some of the growth both in the second and third tier cities as well as e-commerce
So it's a multi-year program that's underway now and I'd say we can continue to update you as the year goes on
I mean, I think for competitive purposes, we prefer not to go into all of the details
But we can give some thoughts to you, what we can share that might help you as you're building your model
We see – we've done very well with online e-commerce in China
As it's a big piece of the marketplace, it's been a nice growth driver for our business
We've continued to see nice growth there and it is clearly amongst the channels, probably our number one area of focus from a channel perspective in that marketplace
So we have – we've built some infrastructure and that will continue to be a place that we'll want to invest in China going forward as in the U.S
