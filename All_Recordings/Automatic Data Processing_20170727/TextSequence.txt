Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning
We appreciate your interest in ADP
This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results, with revenue growth up 6%, both for the quarter and the year
Revenue for the year was up 7% on an organic basis, benefiting from a solid 6% client growth and from the continued strong performance of our downmarket, PEO, and multinational solutions
In line with expectations, our new business bookings declined 7% this quarter and 5% for the year
While we are disappointed with this year's overall bookings performance, it's important to look at the underlying dynamics
The clients were concentrated in our mid- and upmarkets and the challenges were due in large part to growing over the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act
Despite these challenges, the sales opportunities within the mid and upmarkets continue to demonstrates a solid environment with positive growth prospects
We continue to be very pleased with the momentum and performance of our downmarket and the PEO, both of which continue to demonstrate the value of a broad-based portfolio of solutions
During fiscal 2017, we increased our head count investments in our sales organization to better position us for growth during fiscal 2018 and beyond
As the tightening labor market creates additional demand for human capital management solutions, we expect these investments to help us further grow due to the effects of the regulatory uncertainty that prevail within the mid and upmarket since the November U.S
Election
Accordingly, as we return to a more normalized growth trend, we expect fiscal 2018 new business bookings to grow 5% to 7%, gradually expanding back to pre-ACA growth levels as we progress through the year
We remain confident in the strength of our distribution capabilities and the competitiveness of our products
And in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities
Client satisfaction continues to improve, retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are pleased with our progress in upgrading our clients to our latest cloud-based solutions
This quarter, we are also pleased to see retention improvements across all our market segments with retention improving by 60 basis points and finishing ahead of our expectations
Our full-year retention was down 50 basis points to 90%, which also includes a 20 basis point impact from the loss of the Office of Personnel Management contract in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Please note that this contract was part of the CHSA business that we subsequently disposed-off during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. I would also like to remind you that the loss is contributing to our annual decline in retention remain concentrated on our legacy platforms in the mid- and upmarkets
Our excellent retention performance in the downmarket and improving performance in the midmarket reinforces our core belief that our focused and steady upgrade strategy is the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP in the long-term
Core to our philosophy and value proposition is our commitment to developing innovative ways to enhance not only our clients, product, and service experience but also that of our strategic partners
Last quarter, we mentioned the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect, where we are leveraging the scale of our strong 510,000-plus client base downmarket to create a compelling value – to create compelling value for our referral partners
This unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll, including reporting and tax information for our shared clients
It also enables our accountant partners to deepen their relationship with our shared clients by giving them greater insight into payroll data and helps them plan and manage labor costs more efficiently
Adoption of Accountant Connect has been strong
We now have more than 8,000 accounting firms using the platform, which is making life easier for the accountants and the clients we share
This is helping to deepen relationships with an important source of referral business, while increasing our value proposition for RUN clients
We are incredibly pleased with the adoption of the platform by our accountant partners, and we're also especially pleased that we recently received the Accounting and Tax Technology Innovation Award (sic) [Tax & Accounting Technology Innovation Award] (6:39) by CPA Practice Advisor
ADP's success is rooted in part on our ability to help clients manage through regulatory change
This is especially true from our PEO, ADP TotalSource, which served more than 485,000 average worksite employees this quarter
The value proposition of the PEO gets stronger as the complexities of managing the workforce increase and expectations of employees evolve
Great PEOs are built to adapt to these dynamics and help clients navigate these changes
And we believe that our PEO is the clear market leader in both the breadth and depth of service
In June, Internal Revenue Service named ADP TotalSource one of the first certified professional employer organizations
We're proud to be among the first PEOs to receive this important new designation, which certify that ADP adheres to the highest standards
Becoming a certified PEO, further distinguishes ADP and is a another example of the lengths to which we are willing to go to ensure our clients know they're working with a trusted partner
As our clients' needs have grown globally, so have our capabilities and our reach
And today, we are supporting clients in more than 110 countries around the world
Success in the HCM market on a global scale is not easy to achieve, given the complexities of doing business in many different countries and the local knowledge and understanding that is required to support clients
Constellation Research, a strategic advisory firm, recently recognized this by naming ADP GlobalView HCM to the Constellation ShortList for Human Capital Management Suites for the second consecutive quarter
Constellation evaluated more than 25 global HCM platforms to determine the top five best-of-breed vendors
In naming ADP to the ShortList, Constellation recognized us for the depth of our global compliance expertise
Noting that behind the global view product were local compliance experts on the ground monitoring and interpreting legislative changes that affect the more than 14 million clients we support outside the U.S
This global reach remains a truly differentiating capability for ADP and continues to meaningfully contribute to our growth
In closing, we're pleased with our ability to response to the challenges we faced in fiscal 2017. This year, we began to see signs that are improving service metrics and our progress on client upgrades are helping to drive improvements and retention
At the same time, we are beginning to see some signs of stabilization in our mid- and upmarkets new business bookings performance as we lap the difficult fiscal 2016 compares and the fiscal 2017 effects of regulatory uncertainty following the U.S
Election
These dynamics, together with a continued strong performance of our multinational solutions, downmarket offerings, and the PEO, give us confidence heading into fiscal 2018. ADP is built for the long haul
Consistent with our long-term objectives, and consistent with conversations we've had with shareholders, we'll continue to leverage the strength of our business model and our proven ability to execute by making smart investments that enhance our service capabilities, our sales force and deliver best-in-class cloud solutions
We believe these efforts will continue to drive sustained long-term success for our clients, our associates and our shareholders
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan, who'll review our fiscal 2017 results in more detail and share our fiscal 2018 outlook
Good morning
Well, I think as we've said in our comments, the midmarket, the PEO, multinational have all been quite strong
And really, especially, in a downmarket, as we mentioned, has been really no impact from this grow-over issue with ACA
So, we've, I think, had what I would consider to be the best results in several years in that space in the downmarket
In the midmarket, obviously, we had a very significant grow-over, given the strong sales for ACA products in 2016. But as we've kind of checked in with the sales force throughout the year, and frankly, continue to make investments to keep their heads in the game, we've maintained our turnover at almost exactly the same rate it was in the prior year, which is a very encouraging sign because, obviously, it was a very tight labor market
So, my worry was given our performance, we might lose some of our sales force
But I think it's a sign of, I think, optimism on the part of the sales force that there is really no issue with the economy or with our products or competitively or with pricing that it's really just unfortunately a mathematical issue that got aggravated by some of this uncertainty that came out of Washington, which really stop people from buying not only – or slowed the sales of ACA to a much lower level than we had planned, but I think just created some kind of short-term uncertainty after November
I think in the upmarket, we did, I think, feel after November that there was some elongation in terms of decision-making, which is a little more logical because you have relatively sophisticated buyers there
And I think some were probably waiting to see what would happen with the regulatory environment, given that there was talk of repealing ACA and repealing a number of other regulations within weeks, as we all know that hasn't happened
And so, I think gradually things feel like they've gotten a little bit better and things have loosened up a bit
But as we know from what's going on in Washington yesterday and today, I think in that space in particular, I think there's still, I think some probably wait and see on the part of buyers
At least in our experience with our products
And I think if I you stick to like looking at 'our adjusted results,' then you shouldn't even worry about it for next year because the dual ops incremental expenses is minimal
So, there's really nothing to worry about
By the way, those – that will be two years of – so we had a step up of – and it was a 20 basis point impact of dual ops this year
Next year, it's about the same level of expense and then it should fall off, obviously, in the following year
But the restructuring costs themselves for the Strategic Alignment Initiative are non-GAAP
And so you shouldn't have to, I think, worry too much about trying to figure out the analysis there
Because should not be – should not enter into the picture
Other than, obviously, we're incredibly excited about what is going to be the outcome of the Strategic Alignment Initiative down the road
Well, I think that it's obviously very early
We're about halfway through in terms of the hiring plans
So I would say that, I think, we joke around that I think this is the easy part
So putting buildings up and hiring people, we definitely accomplished it
And we're right on track in terms of – and on schedule in terms of our objectives
We feel like we've gotten some great people
We've got great engagements
Obviously, they're in the process of being trained
So, I think all systems, so far, we haven't seen anything to indicate that our expectations that we had of the project are going to be anything other than what we expected
So we're very excited that we've been able to kind of stay on track
But I think it's a little early to really declare victory
But we're very optimistic as this, obviously, is going to create a much enhanced experience for our clients, given that we're putting teams in large locations that are, what we call intact, and are able to deliver services across multiple modules rather than just in silos
Not to mention, obviously, the consolidation effect of having large groups of associates, which we've seen already in two locations that we've had for several years, El Paso and Augusta, creates very, very high engagement, better NPS scores, better client experience, and better associate experience as well
So, we're very excited
It's obviously a big investment
And fortunately, it's on track as of now
Thank you
And I think the last thing you mentioned, which should also, I think, address is, is it related to pricing, and the answer is not
For the last several years, we've been trying to gradually bring down our, 'price increase'
And we've done that again this year
But it's $5 million to $10 million
It's not a big deal on the 'overall gross and net price increase that we passed through to our clients
So – but there's no change in pricing in terms of new business or the competitive environment or anything to that effect
I think it's really related to the factors that we're seeing that Jan was talking about in terms of some of the revenue growth issues
The good news for us is that the scale really starts to pick up again for us in the second half
So if you look at the way this issue has worked with the grow over, part of the confusion might be related to the fact that our fiscal year is in the middle of – obviously, ends in the middle of the year, and the impacts are really calendar-year impacts
And so, if you go back and you look at quarterly numbers, you will see that we had two strong quarters the first half of this fiscal year, and then now we just had two relatively weak quarters because of the grow over issues
So we will have another two-week quarters because of the grow over issue at the beginning of fiscal 2018, and then our plans are that our sales return to near pre-ACA levels in the second half, as well as our revenue growth begins to once again gradually accelerate
Now, of course, that means that we have to hit our plans in retention and new business bookings, but that's the way math does work
Everything we've been telling you, I think, is accurate about the impacts of the grow over of this ACA issue, which were significant
We've mentioned that the business itself is about $175 million in revenue, which means that we sold about $175 million
And so that affected our new business bookings, which is what's causing the grow over from new business bookings
And likewise, the $175 million in revenue, even though it didn't come all in one year, a lot of it did come in January of 2016, which means that from a revenue standpoint, you also have, call it, a point or so of incremental growth that you've picked up from ACA
And then, obviously, now, from a comparison standpoint, you lose a point
And that's right about how the math works because on an organic basis, we're at about 7% growth this year, and we were at about 8% last year
And so our hope is that once we get past the next couple of quarters, that we get back here to business as usual
I think our strength in particular – and we think we've talked about this for several years, is really our multinational solutions really do appear to be highly differentiated
And again, multinationals is both very, very large companies with very large populations of employees, but we also have multinational solutions for a company that may be headquartered somewhere in Europe and has 20 employees in four countries in Europe
So we really go all the way from very, very large Fortune 100 – or world Fortune 100 companies all the way to what I would call local multinationals, if you will, or regional multinationals
And so it's a highly differentiated product
We've had good sales growth over multiple years, double-digit revenue growth, generating great margins because now we've got scale, and the business is – I would just call it humming along
Our international business, I think, has gotten better on, what I would call, a relative basis, because it's been a difficult backdrop in Europe, which is our largest international business
We also have a business in APAC and Latin America, but our largest concentration other than Canada in North America is in Europe
And so that European business on a relative basis, slight improvement in the underlying pays per control
It looks like GDP is starting to pick up a little bit there
Sales, a little bit better this year than we have for the last several years, but I wouldn't say that that business is at the same performance level as the multinational business
We hope it will be at some point in the near future, but the international business, good, solid performance and really good margin performance as well where that business – 10, 15 years ago, my predecessor, we struggled for years to really get that business to perform as well as the rest of ADP from a margin and "retention standpoint," and I think we're kind of there now
So we've got good leadership and I think the business is performing very well
We're very happy with our international and multinational business
Multinational – sorry
I think in total is about $500 million, Jan? Is that
And then what we call international
So the multinational is $500 million
For rounding purposes, call international $1 billion
And then Canada, another $400 million
So that's how you get to approximately 20%
We are on track on the migrations
I think we did about a couple thousand this quarter, probably 2,500 to 3,000 the previous quarter to that
So we're kind of in the same general ballpark, which just as a reminder is much lower than it was at its peak when we were in the middle of ACA, because we had a lot of accelerated migrations in order to get clients on the right platforms to be able to do ACA compliance for them
And then with the benefit of hindsight, that was an issue for us that caused some of our retention challenges
But fortunately that's all behind us now
And now we're back to what we were doing all along for several years, which is migrating clients at the right pace, with the right attention and the right what we call now white-glove service
We have I think it's 5,000 to 6,000 clients left in the midmarket? I'm checking for
About 5,000 to 6,000 clients left
And so you can see that at the pace that we're on now, we have a shot at getting it done by yearend
We might have, whatever, 500 clients, 1,000 clients left at yearend, that doesn't obviously concern me because we would have done, I think, 60,000 clients
So if we have to – and again, the way our business works is everything has to stop in the middle of November because of yearend
And everything starts again in February
In other words, the company just becomes focused on getting through the yearend process
So it could be that we have 500 to 1,000. But it's obviously helping us on a number of fronts because our retention on our strategic platform is much higher than our legacy platform
So as the number of clients gets smaller and smaller, we get a mathematical lift, if you will, just because of the mix issue
So I think it's – I would say that it's probably not something that will be an enormous amount of focus for all of you going forward, but it is an incredible accomplishment
Because I was talking to the person who runs R&D for that organization about a week ago, and he named all the platforms that we had 10 years ago when he first went to that business
And we're down to one platform here, and we're close – almost across the finish line
So the power that that business is going to have now, the focus – and to focus on the competition and to focus on execution and NPS scores and retention is going to be, I think, equal to what we've done in the downmarket on RUN, and that gets me excited
Sure
I think your math is probably pretty close, directionally close
And that's been obviously why we keep focusing so hard on our service experience and our retention rates because obviously every $10 million that we keep is $10 million less for the competition
So that's why you hear us being so keenly focused on retention over the last several quarters
In terms of competitive information, we've said before that we really don't have any one competitor who takes more than 10% of our business, if you will
So there's really not – and that's been consistent for a long, long time
So there is a lot of competition
So we have a lot of competitors, who operate in multiple segment s
The competitors in the downmarket are different from the midmarket
The midmarket is different from the upmarket
Some of them bleed across some of those segments
But in general, we have competitors that tend to be more focused on a particular part of the market than us, which are broadly focused
I think that gives us some advantages, which we leverage in terms of products and service capabilities, et cetera
But at the end of the day, we are very large, and we obviously are the target for a lot of competition
In terms of specifics, we do look very deeply on a quarterly basis at win/losses both head-to-head and sales and also in the book
In other words, clients that we lose to a particular competitor and clients we take away from a particular competitor
In addition to looking at the head-to-head competition from a sales standpoint
And again, this quarter, unfortunately, it's the same story as other quarters, which is there's no discernible pattern other than there were a couple of competitors in particular that we were able to reverse the tide on, which I'm incredibly proud of because as you point out, we have – there's a few of our competitors that aren't even at the size that you mentioned of $300 million
And obviously we are several billion
So whenever you can take the net balance of trade and improve it, it's a big accomplishment, and it shows competitive strength in the products, and it shows execution ability in the sales force as well as on the implementation and on the service side
So there's some glimmers of hope in the last couple of quarters that when we put our minds to it, we can push back, and I think that having clients all-in-one platform, having ACA behind us, there's a number of factors that I think that give me confidence that that focus will be even more heightened on a going-forward basis
And that we'll be able to hopefully make that $300 million, $250 million or $200 million and hopefully slow down some of our competitors
Yeah
We would like to try to help there
And I'll be careful and I'll let Jan do the closing here
Because of the way our business works, it's a recurring revenue business, and events tend to take place at calendar year ends like they did with ACA
So the first two quarters of this fiscal year should not look that different from the first two quarters of this fiscal year from a revenue growth standpoint
If our sales forecasts and our retention forecasts hold true, by the second half of this fiscal year, there will be gradual improvement on the revenue growth
Likewise, when you look at margins – now, clearly, as Jan said, we've been 'adjusting' our expense base to a lower revenue
We just didn't want to do it too quickly because we're trying to focus on retention as well, and we mentioned that we're making investments in sales
But there should be some gradual relief of pressure on the margin in the first half of this fiscal year compared to the second half of last fiscal year
But even more, 'relief' and improvement in the second half
And I would call it significant improvement and relief in the second half
And again, that's all mathematical, and it all works that way, and I think that's probably – I said probably more than I should say, and I'll let Jan
And I think in terms of the relative size of the PEO bookings, I don't know that we don't really give that guidance, but I don't think there's anything wrong with giving you a range of the sales dollars for TotalSource are somewhere around – call it 20% to 25% – 20-ish%, if you will, of the total bookings, somewhere in that range, maybe a little bit higher than that
And again, with good growth, obviously that's driving the top line revenue growth
Yeah
I shouldn't have done that because Jan is right
If you look the sales at the gross level including the pass-throughs, they would be probably, almost as much as our total bookings, because other PEOs probably may report their sales or the new business bookings that way
But obviously we, for the sake of comparability and to make sure that it looks like other ADP business as we do exclude the pass-throughs in the way we count it
So I'll add that we had record retention in a couple of other places as well
So the PEO had record retention
The SBS business in down-market had record retention
We had a couple of other places that had record retention as well
And I think that in most of those cases, the only thing I can put my finger on is execution because they are good businesses, and there's a good backdrop
But for the benefit of hindsight, that's kind of always been true
And I think the one variable seems to be execution
So if we really deliver great products and great service, the clients stay in all of the segments
And so the retention in SBS, for example, now in the downmarket is 3 to 4 percentage points, not basis points, higher than it was five or six years ago and higher than – and that much higher than we thought we would ever be able to achieve
And again, I think it's getting all the clients on one platform so that you make all your investments and you put all your focus and all your R&D on one platform
You heard what we were doing with things like Accountant Connect
It's very hard to do those things when you have three or four platforms
So having everyone on one platform, going after kind of the friction and the things that create bad service experience and just good execution, all those things, I think you put them together, and it's really created a really great story for us that obviously is translating not only into great retention but great retention in these businesses leads to really great margin performance and really good revenue growth
So the visibility that we have is related to the number of salespeople we have and their productivity, what we call annual sales productivity
So we have a lot of data and many years of data around that
And we know that our productivity jumped dramatically when we had ACA sales and obviously came back down when we didn't have that tailwind
But we have ways of getting at the numbers
Having said that, we've said multiple times where it's retention or new business bookings, the amount of visibility we have to that is less than things like revenue next quarter because it's a completely different issue in terms of the recurring revenue, nature of the business makes the revenues, and the margins are somewhat predictable
So new business bookings and retention have less visibility
But we have ways of getting at what we think are the right targets, which I think as you mentioned are much better obviously in the second half
So again, all things being equal, if the economy cooperates and we continue to execute well and the math holds up historically for ADP, we should be able to get to those numbers
And obviously, it doesn't happen in a vacuum
You've got to have great products
You've got to keep sales force turnover down
Those are kind of the controllables that we focus on that, I think we're doing frankly an exceptional job on right now
As you are a very correct observer, Jim
So as an exception in fiscal year 2017, we guided for incremental share buybacks, because we wanted to make – be clear that our intent was to return the proceeds of our debt offering in 2016, which has been completed
So we're now returning to our normal practice, which is we are anticipating to offset equity based dilution for our employer compensation, which is about $400 million or so
And then we should expect – we're aiming to be back at our long-term model that we have shared
And I think the long-term model includes – not that we guide to it – but the long-term model anticipates the return of excess cash to our shareholders of approximately 1% – resulting into approximately 1% of share count reduction
That will be our long-term model and pending on market conditions, obviously
I think it's really too early to read anything into the fourth quarter sales results
Because as Jan just said, we put in incentives to try to get people over the finish line
We frankly also implored the sales force to "not give up," because we don't want to send the wrong signal to the market or to our competitors
And so there's a lot of moving parts here that I think may have contributed
But it was better than the alternative, so we're happy that we had the finish that we had
But I don't think that there's really anything you can scientifically read into it, other than maybe underneath the surface there's some better environment in terms of the – because some of the uncertainty – I mean, at some point people have to get back to business as usual despite what's going on in Washington with regulation and with ACA and so forth
So maybe there's a little bit of that
But we – can't put my finger on it
I wish I could, but our optimism as to your point about why are we optimistic, it relates back to my previous comments around ADP's historical ability to execute in sales related to having the right head count, having the right products, the right sales support, the right incentives, and the right execution
I think with the right economic backdrop, I think should give me – and it does – a high level of confidence and optimism
Again, we haven't heard anything in terms of that would change, for example, the way taxes are collected in this country or that would affect our fluid – I'm not sure exactly maybe where – if there's something you think or you know that we don't know
And we're happy to hear about it or address it
But we're not aware of anything other than they're trying to reduce the corporate tax rate
And obviously there are some, I guess, preferences and benefits that are going to be taken away in order to do that, but those generally apply to, like, the energy sector, manufacturing sector and other
That's why we have a higher effective tax rate
So in theory there are going to be winners and losers
The people with very low effective tax rate are going to probably get an increase in their effective tax rate
And the people who have a high effective tax rate are going to see a decrease because the statutory corporate tax rate is going to – not going to – they're saying they're going to take it down
So whether it's 25% or 20% or 30%, that can only help us
And we don't have any significant tax preferences that we take advantage of that would go the other way
From a client standpoint, we do have a tax credit business
It's relatively small
We haven't heard any talk about – those are targeted job credit-type taxes that are – tax breaks that are very popular
So we haven't heard any talk about that, those being repealed
I would say it's very likely that if there's any tax reform, that it would be very positive for ADP
It could be significantly positive
But obviously as Jan said, we have no sense of the likelihood of that
Just to clarify, and I don't want to be misquoted as saying not seeing much change in the competition because we have a lot of competition
And it feels like we have more of it than we had three years or five years ago or 10 years
But that probably happens to every CEO
They always think that they have more competition than the previous person
So we have an enormous amount of respect for the market and for the competition because there's a lot of it
And we know that we have to earn our place every day in the marketplace by having competitive products and great service
And whenever we slip or trip, they take advantage
And whenever they slip or trip, we take advantage
And so it's very important for us to stay on top of it
But if you're asking about 12 months specifically, there are definitely competitors who have gone – who have kind of come down segments or gone up segments
But I think, based on my experience at ADP, nothing different from what's been happening for decades where a competitor decides if they're in the downmarket, that they can go up into the midmarket
And they try it and then maybe three years later, they go back, or sometimes they stay
Likewise, we've always had enterprise-size competitors that are in the upmarket who decide to come downmarket a little bit into the midmarket
Sometimes they stay
Sometimes they go away
So I don't think I've seen anything worth, I guess, reporting
But plenty of that type of stuff that you just mentioned
But I think it's normal competitive actions by competitors
Thank you very much
We appreciate your time today
As you can see, I think these strategic initiatives that we've laid out over the last several years, I think are beginning to deliver on some of the objectives we have around not just shareholder value but also around delivering world-class solutions to our clients
I'm very proud – it's year-end, so I think I should say that I'm very proud of the hard work and dedication of our associates who obviously have been able to help us deliver these results, including the improvements in the service experience and improvements in retention this quarter
Obviously, we continue to be excited about the prospects ahead of us
We definitely have challenges in 2018 with a softer bookings performance
And as you can tell, we're incredibly bullish and confident still
Otherwise we wouldn't be making the kinds of investments that we're making
So we believe that these investments, along with our ability to execute, I think, really give us the right formula for sustained, continued success for many years to come
So thanks again for your interest in ADP, and thank you for joining us on the call today
