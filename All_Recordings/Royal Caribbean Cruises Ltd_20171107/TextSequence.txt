Thank you, Jason, good morning, everyone
It's been an eventful quarter and certainly an eventful year and as always, I am pleased to give some commentary
I'll start by commenting on the unusual set of hurricanes we experienced this summer
I know that most of the country has moved on to other things, but this was such an unusual and such an impactful set of storms that I need to comment on it
Firstly, I would like to emphasize just how unique this series of storms was
It's highly unusual to be hit with five major hurricanes in a row under any circumstances, but these storms were unusual for another reason as well
Each of these storms followed a path that exactly matched our major trade routes
Somehow these storms seemed to know exactly when and exactly where to hit to cause the most destruction and the most misery
The devastation was heartrending
You can't look at all the damage without feeling the pain our friends had to bear and are still experiencing every day
For us, we have estimated that the direct cost of the storms was in excess of $55 million
That makes it by far the most expensive hurricane season in our 45-year history, but we and they are resilient
You can see how hard our friends in the Caribbean and Texas and in Florida have worked to return to normalcy
They have worked tirelessly to rebuild the homes and the communities that were so devastated
Communications in the Caribbeans are now greatly improved and water has largely been restored
We can attest to the living without electricity is a trial, but the situation is getting better every day and is now mainly a problem in the rural and residential areas
Fortunately, everyone seems to appreciate just how important tourism and especially cruise tourism is to the economic recovery that will be so critical going forward
The government and the local people are highly focused on bringing the tourism infrastructure back up to snuff
They know that tourism continues to be the economic driver that will speed the recovery effort and they have pushed us to reinstate our calls as quickly as possible
The travel agent community has also been a very positive force in this effort
They can get the word out better than anyone else and they have done so yet again here
I've had a chance to visit some of the hardest hit areas and I am very impressed with the progress they are making
We resumed operating cruises from San Juan almost a month ago and we returned to the destination as a port of call later this month
This Friday, we returned to St
Thomas, where our partnership to restore and enhance the iconic Magens Bay has already produced dramatic results
Maarten has been rapidly rebuilding and we will return there in just a few weeks
Overall, I am happy and frankly very impressed to report that the tourist areas, where our guests go, are largely back to their original state
While many residential areas that were damaged are still under repair, the tourist areas that we visit suffered less damage and have mostly been cleaned up
I am also proud of our industry's response in providing humanitarian assistance to this area
Their needs are so great that our impact is necessarily limited, but it's good to be able to give back a little to the region that has been our partner for so long
I'd like to thank our employees, who worked so hard during this challenging period, in many cases, having to do so while dealing with their own exposures at home
The logistical issues were daunting
For example, we had to make more special working (06:14) arrangements in just the month of September than we would normally expect to do so in any normal three-year period
We had to reroute ships, make new provisioning arrangements and communicate with thousands of nervous travelers
Our team did it all smoothly and efficiency
Hats off to them
As an aside, having spent time looking at the situation in the Caribbean, I am convinced that the Caribbean countries that were hit will emerge down the road stronger than they were before the storms
It's going to be a tough slog to get there, but get there they will
There is clearly a determination, not only fix what was destroyed, but to rebuild better than ever
Cruise tourism will undoubtedly be one of the drivers of that resurgence and we, at Royal Caribbean, intend to be a constructive force in that process
I'd like to turn now to the impact of the storms on our bookings
Obviously, the hurricanes interfered with our normal bookings in the area
During the several weeks of the storms, Caribbean bookings dropped precipitously, both for the hurricane period and for the period beyond
None of that is surprising, but what is surprising is how quickly our bookings in the period recovered
The drop-off in bookings was very rapid, but the recovery was also rapid
Today, virtually all our bookings in the region are back to pre-storm levels
There are exceptions, but these remain outliers
Now, this pattern of rapid recovery has implications well beyond just these storms
We believe that this unusually fast recovery may actually be a reflection of an important cultural change
We've noticed a significant change in the way people in general seem to respond to unusual events, whether those events are weather, geopolitical acts or something else
Years ago, a bad incident would have a strong and a lasting impact
Whenever something happened, our bookings would fall and they would stay down for an extended period
People seem to call curl up in a ball and obsess about whatever the issue was
It could and it did impact bookings for a really long time
Even after the event left the front page, people would persist in focusing on it
Eventually, they would move on and bookings would recover, but that process seemed to take forever
More recently, we have seen a much more sanguine response
Instead of the incident lingering for a long time, the recovery seems much quicker
People seem to be more apt today to see such events as ordinary with little impact
The events still aren't normal, but they are seen as less relevant to the broader audience
In effect, the public appears to become inured to such one-off events
They're still interested in the event and concerned about it, but people seem to continue living their lives with less change
They move on
From a societal point of view, I have to say that it's discouraging that we've reached such a point
It's distressing that incidents are now so common that society seems to have formed a thicker skin towards them
On the other hand, as a response to the actual events, it's probably more constructive if society doesn't allow such things to interfere with our normal day-to-day existence
From a purely commercial point of view, this cultural shift is very helpful
It's much better for us if the negative impact of such incidence is so much more fleeting than in the past
Against this background, we are extremely pleased and frankly a little surprised that we are still able to stay within our EPS guidance for the year at a range of $7.35 to $7.40 a share
Indeed, a couple of months ago, when we upped the midpoint of our guidance to $7.40, we thought that we were being reasonably aggressive with our forecast and we certainly didn't expect that we would be raising it anytime soon
The fact that we have been willing to able to withstand a $0.26 hit from the storms and still achieve this level of profitability reflects how strongly the market is performing this year
It's also nice that this performance has allowed us to reach an interesting milestone
Our Double-Double program continues to produce the forward momentum we were hoping for
Indeed, it is exciting and gratifying to note, as [Technical Difficulty] (11:06) press release that we've already achieved Double-Double for the 12 months ended September 30. Specifically, for the last 12 months, our earnings have been more than twice our 2014 EPS and our ROIC exceeded 10%, all this three months ahead of schedule
As you know, the purpose of the program was to galvanize our 67,000 employees to all pull in the same direction
I am overwhelmed by how well our teams responded to the program and I'm extremely grateful for their efforts and initiatives to make the Double-Double so successful
Now, we won't declare victory until 2017 is over, but the very strong energy created by the Double-Double program has been a home run for us
We want to see that energy, that passion, continue indefinitely
Since this is the final year of the Double-Double, we wanted to develop a program that leveraged the culture and the discipline instilled by that program while also including a broader set of goals
As suggested in earlier calls, these goals are focused more on the drivers of success than only the outcomes
We're calling this new journey our 2020 Vision
The 2020 Vision program calls for further improving our brands' already-excellent guest ratings, calls for raising employee engagement scores and it calls for achieving the sustainability commitments made with the World Wildlife Fund
These drivers should help us achieve double-digit earnings per share by 2020, while further improving our double-digit return on invested capital
We see 2020 Vision as our guiding focus for the organization over the coming years
Now, shifting back to the consumer environment and the current booking environment, I'd like to comment on another important consumer trend
The very strong year we're having is, of course, partially due to a strong economy and to the high level of confidence that appears to be prevalent among consumers
However, the trend also reflects a significant shift in the way cruises are viewed by the public, a shift which has been building for a long time
On most of these calls in the past, we've discussed the supply/demand curves for the cruise industry
Usually, the focus of that discussion has been very much weighted towards the supply side
Implicitly, the demand side of the equation was used almost as a given
As a result, we rarely talk much about demand and focus more on supply
I think that misses an important part of the equation
So, today, I want to comment more on the demand side of the equation, because we're experiencing some very real changes there and those changes on the demand side are important to our future
The first point I want to make relates to a phenomenon that seems to be impacting consumers generally
You've all heard me comment in the past that people seem to be more interested today in buying experiences than buying things
5 or 10 years ago, I probably would have cited Samsung or LG as a primary concern of ours, because people are so focused on buying new TV sets or new appliances or whatever
More recently, the focus has decidedly shifted to people looking for experiences, in particular, experiences for the whole family
This shift in the way people vacation plays beautifully to our sweet spot
I believe that we're experiencing the benefits of that shift today and it's partially the reason that we're doing so well
Another factor is that while societal norms have changed, we also have changed to accommodate
Over the years as people's habits and tastes have changed, we've shifted our product to take advantage of these new consumer buying practices
For example, in the 1970s and 1980s, there was a dramatic shift in the way ships were designed and built
Instead of ships being designed as a form of transportation, we shifted to ships that were designed specifically for cruising
Our aspirations at the time were for ships to be more yacht-like
Now, that change really brought cruising into the modern era, but in the 1980s and 1990s, there was another change in people's expectations
The public's vacation desires changed and we needed to shift with them
We shifted our design focus from trying to be yacht-like to being more like hotels
We started to design ships with more spacious public areas, better outfitting and more amenities onboard
We wanted the ships to feel more opened, to have more things to do and to have more luxurious feel of a modern hotel
Our design metaphor changed from trying to seem like a yacht to feeling more like a full-service hotel
Again, that fit in nicely with trends and consumer interests and it resulted in better sales
Now, over the last decade or so, travel habits have further changed and our ship designs have shifted yet again
Consumers now want a more active vacation and more things to do and to experience
In response, we changed our design metaphor from trying to be like hotels to being more like cities
Today, our ships have more of the features of cities with a cornucopia of activities, amenity and design
We don't simply check the box with bars and restaurants and discos; we talk about designing parks and gardens and neighborhoods and quiet spaces
We model our medical facilities on urgent-care facilities
Our specialty restaurants compare to anything you will find on land
We have every stripe of nightlife
You can sail with us for seven nights and never experiencing the same things twice
And again, adjusting our products to suit the changing wishes of the consumer has paid off in a very nice way
Our guests really enjoy the broader choice in amenities that the new ships offer
And again, accommodating these wishes has resulted in improved demand for our product
At the same time, we have also focused on doing a better job of integrating the shipboard experience with the destinations and the cultural enrichment
Ironically, as we continue to offer more and more options for the guest on the ship, their appetite for new experiences off the ship has grown as well
We are taking many steps to satisfy this area too
And again, we believe that accommodating such desires drives improvements to our bottom line
The result of all this evolution has been that cruising and people's vacation habits have evolved together
Vacation habits have evolved over the years and we have evolved our offerings to suit
This has made cruising a more relevant and important vacation for more and more people, nirvana
Now, all of this change in consumers' vacation preferences and in our products has driven a major change in the way we view our customers and in the way our customers view us
This may be one of the more profound changes in our industry for a long time
To understand this profound shift, we have to look at historical approaches
For many years, old and outdated misconceptions about cruising were common in the population
Many consumers thought of cruising through the lens of outdated stereotypes
We, in the industry, often complained about the inaccuracy of such misconceptions and our marketing was geared to correct the image
This sense of not being properly understood pervaded our industry and profoundly influenced all of our communications
But then, a strange thing happened
The evolution of consumers' changing tastes and of our changing product converged
The prevalence of these old erroneous perceptions has waned
In effect, we have won the perception war
We have crossed the tipping point and we are moving beyond it
Yes, there are still many people out there who suffer from these old misperceptions, but their numbers are dwindling every day
Today, while this issue remains an issue at the margin, cruising has now firmly established itself as a relevant and a desirable vacation option for consumers generally
This is especially true as we look at the younger generation, who have embraced cruising as never before
For example, one independent study performed by the Harris organization asked people whether cruising is perfect for them or very good or whatever
In the last six years, the percentage of respondents who state that cruising is perfect or a very good fit has almost doubled
Even more exciting is the fact that the percent of millennials giving that answer has risen even more quickly
You can see that on slide 2 graphically
Now, I'm not suggesting that these misconceptions don't still exist
We know that they do and we won't be happy until everyone understands what a great vacation cruising offers and why it is relevant to them
Nevertheless, we believe that cruising has moved into a new arena and that the increasing relevance of cruise in peoples' holiday plans is partially responsible for the improved environment that we are and have been experiencing
We are proud to have been a part of this transition and we intend to continue pressing the envelope so that this trend will continue to expand
Looking forward, we believe this increased demand will play an important part of the supply/demand equation as we enter a period with somewhat higher supply coming online
2017 has been a particularly strong year with a good economy, good consumer confidence driving high demand
Our forward bookings for next year would indicate a continuation of yield growth
However, it would be naïve of us to continue to assume that the unusually strong 2017 would continue indefinitely
Now, before I turn the call back to Jason, I'd like to comment on some of the other changes happening in our business
This past August, we cut steel for our new Quantum Ultra Class ship and we confirmed the ship's name, Spectrum of the Seas
Like its sister ships, Quantum of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas, she is destined for the Chinese market, where she will make her debut in 2019. This is our 10th year in the China market
While this market has recently experienced bumps in the road, we believe that the significant investments we have made, the management team we have developed and the assets that we have deployed put us in a strong leadership position
We remain committed to this strategic part of the world and we believe it will continue to pay good dividends
Now, I also can't wait to show off our new arrivals next year, Symphony of the Seas, which is arriving in spring of 2018, and Celebrity Edge, which debuts in the fall of 2018. We also recently announced that Azamara Pursuit will join our Azamara Club Cruises brand, which increases our capacity there and upgrades our capabilities
We are also introducing two major fleet renovation programs for our Royal and Celebrity brands, Royal Amplified and Celebrity Revolution
We believe that these major upgrading efforts will help further solidify our position as leader in hardware and in innovation
With so much going on, you can see why we are excited about the future
Before I turn the microphone back to Jason, I want to express again my appreciation and my admiration to all of our employees who worked so hard and with such skill at delivering fantastic vacations to so many
With their support, the future is indeed bright
Jason?
Steven, it's Richard, and if I could just add something to that, and yes, we won't hate you, but first of all, I think there aren't many companies that are giving three-year targets with – you said only 11% to 12% growth rates
I think that's pretty good in the first place
But I also think – I like to emphasize that these programs really aren't intended to be financial targets for the investment community
This is something that really that we use for our employees, for ourselves to drive how we manage the business
And it's really intended to focus on the drivers of success, on the good performance of our fleet, the satisfaction of our guests, the engagement of our crew, et cetera
And so, the financial metrics come out of that, but internally, I think that was really the success of the Double- Double, was it got everybody pushing to the things that would make us successful
And so, I would just emphasize that
I understand it needs to have that financial metrics as well and those are important and that's also part of what we need to communicate to our people
But I would just like to say, I think we feel quite good about the 2020 program and think it will drive us to continue to excel
I think Adam maybe would comment on that
So, hi, Jamie
Most of that are the two ship modernization programs that you cited
It's been something and we found we've been very successful with that in some of the ones we've been doing over the last few years
So, this is a continuation of that
Some of the things that we've done on our newer ships are just really very impactful in terms of consumer trends and what they want
And so, that's very much a part of it
So, that's the bulk of it actually
There is also some of it that is related to our technological investments, in particular our digital investments, which we call Excalibur
So, we've talked about that
We have an investment day, where we're going to be talking about that in today or tomorrow in a lot more detail, but we see those technological investments
We've frankly already been making a lot, but I think we see the need increasing
And so, that is part of the increase that you're referring to
Yes, it does
Interestingly, when we talk about the two programs, Celebrity Revolution and Royal Amplified, really a lot of the thinking that's going into that is really thinking through how our guests spend is changing and you'll start to see that when we bring these ships out of the modernization, the program that we've really reallocated space to generate better revenues in areas that we see guests now naturally gravitating to
Well, David, thank you
I think you summarized my view accurately
I do think that the underlying strength of the industry is powerful and I think that will continue
I just think one needs to be a little bit realistic about how quickly you can move those things
And so, we think, obviously, we are not trying to direct the organization to a level of yield increase
We clearly want to maximize that
What we want to pivot the organization to is to provide the things that will drive consumer to our travel agents and to our website and basically to buy cruises
And hopefully that will result in continued strong yield improvement
So, by saying moderate yield increase, I think we are really trying to telegraph that to get strong results, we don't need staggeringly large yield improvements
We are an industry where if we can get relatively moderate yield increases, that results in really very strong bottom line growth
But obviously if we can break out of the 2% to 4% range, as we did this year, we intend to exercise every effort we know how to accomplish that
So, obviously, I think that was a point I was trying to emphasize
You have to look at both sides of that
You have to look at the supply side of it and the demand side of it
And I absolutely agree with you, the increase in the supply is clearly a factor in that
I think the reason that I'm expressing confidence is that I believe that the increasing demand more than compensates for that, because the new ships are more attractive and they bring in more people and also they attract higher yields
So, I think we've tried to look at this and we've tried to put the 2020 Vision together, taking into account all that we know about the next year – the next few years and that includes the supply side, which, as you say, is a little bit higher than it has been
Tim, on your question on the rollout of Excalibur, the new digital system, it's pretty much going along the path that we had previously said
The hurricanes did mess us up a bit, obviously, disrupted operations for a good six to seven weeks and that probably caused a corresponding delay in some of the detailed rollouts
But overall, we are still expecting to be, and you'll see more of this tomorrow, of course, 12% or 13% by the end of 2017, half by the end of 2018 and almost everything by the end of 2019. So, by and large, as frustrating as the disruption was, that's pretty much going on track
