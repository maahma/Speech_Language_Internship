Core FFO per share was $0.06 ahead of the consensus although the first quarter may be somewhat of a high watermark for the first part of the year as you can see here on page 12. We don't typically give quarterly guidance but it's important to note that we expect the run rate to dip down in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter due to a combination of higher property tax accruals, higher G&A expense related to promotions, merit increases and timing of stock grants, as well as the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May
