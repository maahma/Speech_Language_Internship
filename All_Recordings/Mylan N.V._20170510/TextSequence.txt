Thank you, Heather, and good morning, everyone
Before I begin, I too would like to thank our employees around the world for their continued dedication and hard work as well as their unwavering focus on our mission and business objectives
It is this focus from each and every one of them that allowed us to again deliver strong performance around the world
Let's turn to the first quarter results where we have reported according to our new regional segments
I'll provide an overview of our top line performance and Ken will get into segment profitability
Overall, our total business delivered revenue of approximately $2.7 billion for the quarter, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year
This performance is once again driven by the strength, diversity and the resilience of the assets we have assembled and successfully integrated
The global pricing environment was again consistent with our expectations and previous guidance
Tony will provide an update on this topic shortly
In North America, our business grew approximately 5% to more than $1.2 billion
This increase was primarily due to net sales from the acquisitions of Meda and the Renaissance Topicals Business
These increases were partially offset by the net impact of lower net sales from new products and existing products
As anticipated, sales of EpiPen Auto-Injector declined in the current quarter as a result of increased competition and the impact of lower priced authorized generic
Excluding the impact of EpiPen, our North American business would have been up approximately 20%
This year, EpiPen will represent less than 5% of global revenues and less than 10% of sales in North America
In Europe, sales totaled about $900 million, a year-over-year increase of 53%
The increase was primarily the result of net sales from acquisition of Meda
We continue to grow our leadership position in key European markets, such as Italy, where we recently became the generics market leader, and France
We also continued to experience sustained growth in our key products across the region
In Rest of the World, sales totaled about $580 million, a year-over-year increase of 34%
This increase was primarily driven by acquisition of Meda
In addition, net sales from existing products increased, as high volumes offset lower pricing throughout the segment
We were especially pleased to see a return to strong growth in our ARV franchise, with double digits year-over-year growth
We look forward to continued opportunities for growth in ARV with the launch of our TLE400 product in the developing world
We continue to make good progress in the integration of Mylan and are on track to realizing our synergy targets, as evidenced by the decrease in our SG&A spend on a percentage basis year over year
We also continue to leverage revenue synergy opportunities by operating as One Mylan
With now three quarters under our belt, these acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and we are well-positioned to leverage these assets and see continued benefits from these assets
With regards to our operating platform, Mylan has always had a deep and unwavering commitment to quality everywhere we operate
FDA standards for our industry continue to evolve, and this continues to raise the bar for every player in our industry, which is something we very much welcome
For Mylan's part, we are dedicated to continually enhancing our systems and processes with a deliberate and thorough approach to ensure sustainable quality across our entire network of facilities, working closely with FDA to resolve any issues that come our way
As you are aware, we recently received a warning letter at our Nashik site in India
We are working closely with the FDA to respond to and address the issues raised in the letter as comprehensively and expeditiously as possible
Production from Nashik site continues uninterrupted, and we anticipate no material impact to Mylan's overall business as a result of this warning letter
At the same time, we have successfully completed remediation efforts at the three sites acquired from Agila that were under FDA warning letters
The warning letters have been lifted at both SFF [Specialty Formulation Facility] and SPD [Sterile Product Division] sites and we are pleased with our progress at OTL [Onco Therapies Limited] site, which also was very recently inspected by FDA
I note that during the quarter, we had 15 inspections by various global regulators across our 50 facilities
In fact, the Nashik site is in good standing with other global regulatory entities, including WHO and MHRA, which inspected the site following FDA and issued a GMP compliance certificate
Turning now to some of our key pipeline programs, with regards to our biosimilar portfolio, we continue to make good progress on our applications and are working closely with the various health authorities on the reviews and with regard to the GCP and GMP inspection of our facilities
We remain on track with all key programs, including insulin glargine
As a reminder, during the quarter we announced that we agreed to the terms of a global settlement with Genentech and Roche in relation to patents from Herceptin, which provides Mylan with global licenses for our trastuzumab product, excluding Brazil, Japan, and Mexico
This global license will provide a clear pathway for Mylan to commercialize its product in various markets around the world commencing on the license effective dates
As of this quarter, we now have approval for our trastuzumab biosimilar in 15 developing markets
On the respiratory front, we received a Complete Response Letter from FDA regarding our ANDA for generic Advair Diskus
We have carefully assessed the CRL, which represents a full review of the ANDA from all FDA disciplines
Although it's designated as a major CRL, we have a difference of opinion with the agency on certain items raised in the CRL
We believe that the resolution of some of these points, based on our previously agreed-upon protocols with FDA, can potentially change this major designation of the CRL
In any event, the agency has again explicitly confirmed that they consider this application a high priority
For these reasons, it's important for us to have this interaction with the FDA before we can comment further upon the potential impact of the CRL
Regardless of the timing, we remain confident that there will be a significant market opportunity for a substitutable generic to Advair and that demand for this product will be strong
I would also like to note that we are ready from both a manufacturing and commercial perspective to launch upon approval
It's important to note that our Dublin manufacturing facility was inspected by FDA in June of 2016, and we have been informed that this facility is in good standing
Turning to Copaxone, we have a target action date for both the 20-milligram and 40-milligram for next month
We see no reason that these dates cannot be met
We believe that all scientific questions have been resolved to FDA satisfaction and we also believe that there are no facility GMP issues that should be a barrier to approval of this ANDA
Generally speaking, we believe that the process for approving complex generics continues to be an area that requires greater focus and clarity
And we believe that FDA is committed to enhancing its capabilities and approach in this area
We are encouraged by the comments by the new FDA Commissioner that this process will be a priority for him, as he assumed his new office
We remain very committed to investing in complex products through our robust R&D efforts
Mylan is distinguished from many of our competitors as a result of our willingness to make the substantial investments required over the long term to continue to bring these needed products to the patients
Although you will continue to see some variability in our quarterly R&D spending due to the timing of program spend, there is no change to our overall commitment to investment in R&D
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tony for some additional perspective on commercial landscape
Thank you
And I would just add that we have taken into consideration this alliance into our projections
So let me take the easy one first, which is Copaxone, and just talk about our readiness
Yes, you will expect us to be in a state of readiness from the manufacturing point of view – from commercial manufacturing point of view in anticipation of the target action dates
Regarding generic Advair, so let me reiterate that this submission was done in complete accordance to the product-specific guidance and pre-agreed protocols
And we have not been asked to do any additional clinical endpoints or device-related studies at this juncture
What we have been asked is now that some of the studies, especially the device-related studies, we have now been asked to analyze and report our findings of our study against the newly issued industry draft guidance for conduct of human practice studies – draft guidance
So that's what we want to go back and discuss with FDA, and we can get this meeting any day
We have been waiting for this meeting and it can happen any moment or any day
And we can only comment upon the potential impact of the CRL once we have these discussions behind us
So that's what we are waiting for before we comment upon any impact on timing
Yeah, Gregg, on Advair, I mean, there is nothing in my voice you should hear that we don't feel comfortable about interpreting our data to the new guidance, but we have a difference of opinion at a policy level that agency is applying a draft guidance as against a pre-approved or pre-agreed protocol
So that's what we're trying to discuss and negotiate with them because it all adds to the timing and the classification of the CRL
Second, on Lantus, we are very much on track and you should expect to hear from us anytime now about our regulatory filing in USA
It's too early for us
We have sought a meeting and we have been told that FDA is working on to grant us a meeting, or very soon we'll hear from them
And I don't want to comment anything beyond that
We should be able to be in a good position to talk about it once we have this meeting behind us
Nashik is not limited to antiretrovirals
Nashik is a global site and does produce some U.S
products and some of the U.S
launches will be potentially impacted by that
But as I confirmed, they are not material to our overall Mylan's business
There's no discussion in this complete response letter or a point being made about this being not 505(j) or being about 505(b)(2)
And we don't see because it is exactly – the product is exactly as per the guidance issue by the FDA
It has been accepted as 505(j)
So I don't want to even think and comment about that because it's not real
So I don't want to speculate on that
And, Umer, Vytorin launch has been impacted by the Nashik warning letter
And I think that one of the questions was do we see any more government instituted price cuts and all that
No, Marc, we don't see at this time what we saw a few years back
And this Meda acquisition and Abbott acquisition has so well positioned us to leverage anything we drop in and add on to that platform now
And, Andrew, regarding business development, we are executing to the plan, which we shared with you on our Investor Day
We have a very exciting and active and rich pipeline, which we are trying to close certain deals and bring products home
So we see many tuck-in opportunities out there
And, Chris, as I earlier mentioned, it will be prudent for us to wait for this dialogue before we comment on the potential impact on any timing our Advair launch
And with regarding your question on Neulasta, you can expect us to have this product end of – towards the end of 2018 or early 2019.
Thank you
