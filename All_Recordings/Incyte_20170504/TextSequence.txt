Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone
In the first quarter, we recorded $384 million of total revenue
This was comprised of $294 million in net product-related revenue and $90 million in contract revenue
Product-related revenue of $294 million represents 43% growth over the same period last year
It is comprised of $251 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $14 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $29 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis and $400,000 in Olumiant royalties from Lilly
Our commercial operations in Europe continue to perform well and I'm pleased to confirm that Takeda has notified us they will not be exercising the buyback option related to Iclusig product rights in Europe
The $90 million in contract revenue consists of a milestone paid to us by Novartis related to a Phase 3 study for ruxolitinib in GVHD, and a milestone paid to us by Lilly for the European approval of Olumiant
The first quarter Jakafi royalties of $29 million represents 32% growth over the same period last year, but is slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, because the royalty tiers reset each calendar year, and we are in the lower tier in the first part of each year
In addition, Olumiant royalties of $400,000 reflect the product approval and launch by Lilly late in the first quarter
Based on the recent news of the baricitinib complete response letter in the U.S
, we have decided to take a very conservative approach around milestone guidance for the remainder of 2017, and we are removing remaining baricitinib approval and development milestones from our 2017 financial guidance
Our revised milestone guidance is now up to $130 million for the full year 2017, of which we have already recognized $90 million in the first quarter
We believe that this is a very fluid situation, and we look forward to updating you on any material changes to our milestone guidance at the appropriate times once we get more clarity
Our gross-to-net adjustments for the first quarter was approximately 15%
This was driven primarily by Jakafi and as with similar oral oncology products, our gross-to-net adjustment is higher in the first quarter of the year than the rest of the year, primarily because our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients
We expect our gross-to-net adjustment for the full year 2017 will be approximately 13%
Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $15 million
This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S
Jakafi net sales and the amortization of the acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition in Europe
Our R&D expense for the quarter was $408 million, including $22 million in non-cash stock compensation and $209 million in upfront and milestone expenses related to the amended Agenus collaboration and the new Merus and Calithera collaborations
Given the recently announced expansion of our development collaboration agreement with Merck and also now with BMS for the initiation of Phase 3 studies of epacadostat, we are updating our current R&D guidance to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion
This includes the $209 million in upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborations previously mentioned
Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $87 million including $9 million in non-cash stock compensation
We recorded $7 million in expense related to the change in the fair market value of a contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability in the first quarter
Moving on to non-operating expenses, we recorded $6 million of unrealized loss on our long-term investments in Merus and Agenus, net interest expense of $5 million and one-time debt exchange expense of $54 million related to senior note conversions
During the quarter, we significantly de-levered our balance sheet in a cost-effective manner by entering into agreements with some of the holders of our 2018 and 2020 notes to exchange a total of $703 million in aggregate principal amounts for a 13.5 million shares of our common stock
We recorded $54 million in expense related to the senior note conversions
These transactions resulted in reduction of debt in the balance sheet and an increase of our outstanding share count
And at the end of the quarter, the value of our remaining senior notes has decreased to $42 million and our outstanding share count has increased to 204.6 million shares
Accordingly, interest expense will be lower in subsequent quarters of the year
We recorded tax benefit of $11 million on the pre-tax loss in the first quarter
This tax benefit will reverse over remaining quarters of the year based on net income projections for the full year in certain states
We anticipate recording an insignificant consolidated tax expense for the full year in 2017. For the first quarter, we recorded a net loss of $187 million
The net loss was primarily driven by the upfront and milestone expenses related to the Merus, Calithera and Agenus collaborations of $209 million and the one-time expense related to the senior note conversions of $54 million
Subtracting these items, net income would have been $60 million
Looking at the balance sheet
We ended first quarter with $512 million in cash and marketable securities and expect to end the year with over $600 million in cash and marketable securities
Incorporating the changes the guidance previously discussed, we now expect to have a net loss for the full year of approximately $150 million to $170 million
Subtracting the previously detailed $209 million upfront in milestone expenses and $54 million note conversion expanses forecasted net income for the full year would be approximately $90 million to $120 million
To summarize, Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth for the first quarter
We entered into new collaborations which expanded product pipeline and we continue to make significant advancements in our clinical development programs as evidenced by our announcement to enter into multiple additional Phase 3 studies with epacadostat
Incyte is well positioned from a revenue and cash perspective to fund our development programs, and we are confident we will deliver significant long-term shareholder value
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks
