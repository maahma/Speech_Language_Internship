As for our scanner business, recall that 2016 revenue and volume growth significantly benefited from the unfilled backlog carried over from 2015. And while we expect the scanner business to do well and continue to grow, we would not expect the same rate of growth of volume and revenue as we saw in 2016. We expect operating margins to be flat to slightly up over our 2016. Those investments will include geographic expansion both in countries and markets we already serve, as well as expansion into new territories including Latin America and India
