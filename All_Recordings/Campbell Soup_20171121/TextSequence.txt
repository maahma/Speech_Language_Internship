Thanks, Ken
Good morning and welcome everyone to our first quarter call
Today, we’ll discuss our results in the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and the actions we’re taking to improve our performance and to position Campbell for long-term growth
When we last spoke in September, we outlined our expectations for fiscal 2018 and indicated that we anticipated a challenging first half
However, the first quarter was weaker than we expected, particularly for our U.S
soup business
In the quarter, our organic sales declined 2%, driven primarily by declines in U.S
Adjusted EBIT declined 14%
There were several factors that contributed to this performance
First, in September, we discussed how a key customer’s different promotional approach to the soup category would negatively impact our U.S
soup business in fiscal 2018. This had a larger impact on sales than originally anticipated, primarily due to a lower seasonal inventory build compared to a year ago
The dialogue with this key customer remains open, and I’m very optimistic that we will reach a positive resolution
Second, unfavorable weather negatively impacted carrot crop yields and led to supply constraints and higher than expected cost
As a result, we placed customers on allocation in the quarter
We expect to be off allocation by December
And finally, the hurricane recovery efforts in Florida and Texas resulted in higher than expected supply chain costs, due to the surge in demand for transportation and logistics
We’ll be impacted by this in the near-term but the cost impact will moderate over time
As a result of the factors that impacted gross margin and our commitment to maintain investments in the business, we updated our fiscal 2018 guidance, this morning
For fiscal 2018, our outlook for sales remains unchanged
We continue to expect net sales to be in the range of minus 2 to flat for the year
However, we have lowered our earnings outlook, reflecting our gross margin performance in the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year
We now expect adjusted EBIT to change by minus 4% to minus 2%, previously minus 1 to plus 1%, and adjusted EPS to change by minus 3 to minus 1%, previously flat to plus 2%
The operating environment remains challenging for the many reasons we’ve cited over the past year, but we continue to believe that it’s imperative to invest back in our business to differentiate our brands, to drive innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing, and snacking to accelerate our e-commerce capabilities and to diversify our portfolio
That’s why we remain committed to reinvest a portion of our ongoing cost savings into the areas that hold the greatest prospects for growth
In Q1, we continued to invest back in our core business and in the pursuit of new growth opportunities including support for our product innovations, our real food efforts, building our e-commerce unit as well as funding longer term innovation efforts
First, we’re supporting our new product innovations such as Well Yes! soup and Chunky Maxx soups, Pepperidge Farm farmhouse cookies and Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, a dairy alternative with 10 grams of protein
Second, in real food, we completed the transition out of BPA in our can linings in the United States and Canada, and continue to convert our soups to chicken with no antibiotics
Third, our newly formed e-commerce unit in North America has been very active
While small, our e-commerce sales increased significantly in the quarter
We launched several meal kits through our strategic partnership with Chef’d
We also made progress on enhancing our distribution capabilities in partnership with DHL, opening a facility in Fort Worth and breaking ground on another in Ohio
This will help meet the growing demand for customization from both traditional and e-commerce customers
In health and well-being space, we continue to fund Habit, a personalized nutrition start-up
Habit is an example of how we’re investing in new models of innovation
Over time, we expect multiple business models to emerge
Following the national launch of its nutrition test kits in August, the Habit team is expanding rapidly and adding top talent
And we also continued our venture capital activities as the single limited partner in Acre Venture Partners
However, these efforts are not enough
While we’re moving in the right direction and positioning the Company for long-term success, our Q1 results are clear indication that we have more to do to complete our strategic transition, including more innovation, focused on health and wellbeing, and snacking, gaining a larger share of e-commerce revenue and a greater presence in growth channels, increased expansion in developing markets and continued focus on external development
Speaking of external development, as you know, on September 27th, we delayed the closing of our acquisition of Pacific Foods of Oregon, pending their resolution of some recently filed litigation unrelated to Campbell
While the timing is not yet definite, we have reason to believe that conditions will be met that will allow us to complete the transaction by the end of 2017. With that as context, I’ll review our performance across our divisions
Let’s start with Americas Simple Meals and Beverages where sales and operating earnings, both declined
The decline in the topline was driven primarily by U.S
soup and V8 beverages
soup sales declined 9%
As I stated earlier, a lower seasonal inventory build versus year ago at a key customer accounted for 7 points of the decline and 2 points were due to reduced consumer takeaway
There is positive performance in the balance of the marketplace, where our soup program has been well received and consumer takeaway is up slightly
We have strong business plans with our key customers; we’re driving trial of our new products, Well Yes!, Chunky Maxx and Swanson soup kits
And we continue to support our brands with competitive levels of advertising and consumer promotion
While we’re experiencing private label competition in our broth business, private label market share in soup is below average for center store food categories and up slightly
We constantly innovate and test our products to ensure they meet or exceed consumer taste preferences
We believe that innovation and brand differentiation are critically important in the soup category, which is why we’re continuing to invest in our brands
The shelf-stable beverage category remained challenged, and sales of V8 products declined
Despite this decline, we’re seeing positive consumption trends on V8 Vegetable Juice and V8 +Energy
We’re pleased with the sales gains of our Simple Meal products, driven by Prego as well as sales growth in Canada in food service
Looking ahead, we expect the operating environment to remain challenging
And therefore, we’re taking additional actions to improve our performance
We started to shift our soup marketing spending from equity building campaigns to a sharper focus on product attributes that differentiate Campbell brands
We’re increasing in-store presence with stronger messaging and we’re aggressively ramping up our ecommerce plans
Now, shifting to our Global Biscuits and Snacks division
Overall, I feel good about our performance in Global Biscuits and Snacks to start the year
This division delivered growth on both the top and bottom lines
Sales gains were primarily driven by the continued solid performance of Pepperidge Farm
This sales growth was fueled by our snacks business with one-two punch from crackers and cookies
Our Goldfish crackers continued to outperform the category in a meaningful way
In fact, Goldfish became the number one snack cracker in the category over the last quarter
The brand’s continued growth was fueled by our increasing ounces into houses approach
This is all about providing wholesome delicious snacks that can be enjoyed in a variety of new packaging formats including single-serve multipacks
The second driver of our sales growth was our cookie business behind the successful launch of the Farmhouse brand, Milano cookies and the rejuvenated Pepperidge Farm chunk cookie line
The Farmhouse launch is one of Pepperidge Farm’s best product introductions in over a decade with strong trial and repeat
Made with simple ingredients, this thin, crispy cookie is the type of snack consumers are seeking and has been incremental to the category
We employed a similar approach with our Pepperidge Farm chunk cookies
We improved our recipes using larger chocolate chunks and cage-free eggs, while also updating and simplifying our packaging
It’s satisfying to see our real food philosophy resonating with consumers in our cookie portfolio
Outside the U.S
, Asia-Pacific sales were mixed
Sales declines in Australia were partly offset by gains in Indonesia
We faced increased competitive activity in Australia’s chocolate biscuits but delivered solid results in savory crackers behind the reintroduction of original shapes crackers where we gained share
Now, let’s turn to Campbell Fresh
In Campbell Fresh, sales were comparable to a year ago
We’re encouraged that our CPG products grew for the second consecutive quarter behind Garden Fresh Gourmet and Bolthouse Farms salad dressing
Sales of Bolthouse Farms beverages were comparable to year ago
We are now back to normal beverage capacity
Our new co-packer was fully operational midway through the quarter
And our service levels steadily improved, helping us instill confidence with customers
As a result, we started to return to more normal levels of promotional activity, late in the quarter and expect that trend to continue in the second quarter
Looking ahead, we have strong innovation plans in place with the continued rollout of Bolthouse Farms plant protein milk, new Garden Fresh Gourmet’s fresh soup and salsa products in the first half and a range of Bolthouse Farms dressing and beverages in the back half
Turning to farms
Sales of carrots declined in the quarter
Our carrot crops were negatively impacted by adverse weather
Due to these low yields, we placed customers on allocation in the quarter
Learning our lesson from a similar experience in 2016, the new Campbell Fresh team did not compromise the quality of carrots we delivered to customers
As stated earlier, we expect that we’ll be off allocation by December
We continue to expect Campbell Fresh to return to profitable growth this fiscal year
While I’m not satisfied with our results this quarter, I’m also not deterred
Despite challenges within U.S
soup, V8 and carrots, other parts of the business are growing
The Global Biscuits and Snacks division remained a bright spot, especially Pepperidge Farm
Simple Meals, Canada and food service performed well and the Campbell Fresh turnaround is progressing
We’re taking the appropriate steps to address our immediate issues and remain focused on the actions that will position Campbell for long-term growth
We will continue to invest to differentiate our brands, enhance our real food credentials, drive innovation, particularly in health and wellbeing and snacking, build our e-commerce organization, and pursue smart external development
Thank you
And now, I’ll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anthony DiSilvestro
There is no question, Ken, that we have experienced volatility in the carrot business due primarily to weather issues in California dealing with extremes in rain and heat, which has affected the crop
While we can’t control the weather, we can control what we do about it
And I believe that we did the right thing this time around by putting customers on allocation, not harvesting early, and keeping the quality of our carrot
Understand that the role of carrots in this business is it’s the scale of distribution for the CPG products
And one of the reasons why we acquired the business was to grow the CPG portion and recognize that the carrots are the chassis for distribution at best pricing
So, we’ll continue to take this into consideration going forward
We’d like to get to the point of stability in carrots and growth in CPG, and that’s our strategy
Well, I can’t talk about any specifics
I can say that the dialogue remains open and it’s very positive
I’ll answer that question from a couple of perspectives
First of all, in the rest of the market, soup program has been very strong
New products have been well-received, new Well Yes! is at 83% ACV distributions, we're supporting the brands, new Chunky Maxx has hit the market now with 40% more protein, and protein is really on trend
So, we’re pretty pleased with the performance in the rest of the market with consumption up slightly
So that -- and we believe we’ll continue to see that momentum into the second quarter
The other fact is that our other businesses in this key retailer are incredibly robust
So, I would say that I do agree that the soup situation is isolated
I’ll take the first part, Andrew
We said this in September, but we expect that the first half on soup will be weaker than a year ago, and we expect some more momentum in the second half
I don’t think private label is a new phenomenon
Private label is pretty prevalent
And what we have seen is more of a push on private label in the broth business in the market at large
Actually, our -- the share that private label has of condensed soup and RTS soup is significantly below the average in center store categories and only up slightly
But broth has definitely been impacted
The Pacific Foods brand is highly differentiated, being organic and natural
So, we believe that will be a good add to our line
Just for clarification, because we’re in the snacks category and many fresh categories, are you referring to the soup category?
Okay
Let me star there
In our Pepperidge Farm business, we’ve seen a lot of robust consumption, particularly on Goldfish and cookies as I stated before
We continue to increase our shelf space merchandising
So, they are really doing a great job
In Campbell Fresh, again, the CPG part of the business has returned to growth, up a couple of points for the second consecutive quarter
And we didn’t start promoting beverages until October
So, we will now return to a normal promotion schedule in quarter two and we have a huge innovation suite coming to market in quarter three
So, we believe that the CPG part of Campbell Fresh will have momentum
In the soup category and the rest of the market, we continue to see robust plans
We do audit shelf every year, but we have not gotten results of that
We’ll let you know when we do
And so, we’re just running our play
I’m not going to comment on the specifics of customer programs
I mean, all I’m willing to say is that we are in open discussion and positive about it
Chris, in addition, we have a very robust supply chain productivity program
Since we’ve integrated the supply chain into Campbell’s and put them on our productivity program, we have a very good line of sight to some significant cost savings, which will enhance the profitability of the business
We do very robust analytics on our price gaps and thresholds of the brands versus private label
So, we have a good indication of what that looks like, both from the regular retail pricing and also the merchandising pricing with the frequency that we merchandise
So, that’s under constant watch
We’ve been doing that forever
So, I would just say that in the broth business, what we have done to address private label, and that’s where we have experienced the competition, is, we’ve changed our advertising messaging more to house once and is differentiated versus private label, starting with the fact that the first ingredient in Swanson is chicken stack whereas the first ingredient in most private labels is water
And so, we’re calling attention to some of the attributes that distinguish the Swanson brand from private label
And then, of course, the pending acquisition of Pacific, as I mentioned, we’re pretty enthusiastic about what differentiation that brand brings to the line
In RTS and condensed, private label is a factor but it’s really under average, and we haven’t seen an increase
I mean, it’s been up slightly
But, we continue to watch it and we’ll make sure we continue to be competitive
Yes
We said in September and continue to believe that we will have a weaker first half than second half in soup, based on what we know at this point
And in terms of the gross margin, Anthony, do you want to handle that one?
Yes
In the back half, we have a greater mix in our Global Biscuits and Snacks business in Campbell Fresh
The main thing to focus on is the consumption; in the quarter, soup consumption was down 2.3%
We have a couple of things going on there
And our e-commerce business is still small and for the industry, it’s small
But, we’re focused on building capabilities in terms of really understanding the consumers’ path to purchase in that space
We are working predominantly with pure play e-tailers and also omni, and we’re working with Chef’d on meal kits in that space
So, we’re trying some different things
We’re working literally across all of our brands and bundling brands based on what the customer wants to do in that space
So, I think we’re trying a lot of things
One of the things that’s very encouraging though is we’ve brought in some top talent
And we believe that as more consumers shift to e-commerce, whether it’s order online pick up at store or order online and deliver to home, will be well-poised to participate and lead in that space
