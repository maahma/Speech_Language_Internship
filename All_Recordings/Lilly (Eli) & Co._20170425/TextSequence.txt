Thank you for joining Eli Lilly & Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call
I'm Dave Ricks, Lilly's President and CEO
Joining me on today's call are Derica Rice, our Chief Financial Officer; Dr
Jan Lundberg, President of Lilly Research Labs; Enrique Conterno, President of Lilly Diabetes and Lilly USA
Sue Mahoney, President of Lilly Oncology; Jeff Simmons, President of Elanco Animal Health; and I'd like to extend a special welcome to Christi Shaw, who joined us earlier this month as President of Lilly Bio-Medicines
We're also joined by Kristina Wright, Chris Ogden and Phil Johnson of the IR team
During this conference call, we anticipate making projections and forward-looking statements based on our current expectations
Our actual results could differ materially due to a number of factors, including those listed on Slide three and as outlined in our latest Forms 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC
The information we provide about our products and pipelines is for the benefit of the investment community; it is not intended to be promotional and it is not sufficient for prescribing decisions
Before discussing key events for the quarter, I'll start with a summary of our progress on our strategic objectives since our earnings call in January
Starting with grow revenue
Q1, we generated worldwide revenue growth of 7%, which was driven by 9% volume growth in our pharmaceutical business, led by our new products
On our strategic objective of expand margins, our non-GAAP gross margin percent, excluding the effect of FX on international inventory sold, increased by nearly 220 basis points compared to Q1 2016. And total operating expenses as a percent of revenue also declined by nearly 220 basis points
Under the heading of sustaining the flow of innovation, we launched baricitinib under the trade name Olumiant in Europe for rheumatoid arthritis
, we were disappointed to receive the complete response letter from the FDA for baricitinib in RA
We remain confident the benefit-risk of baricitinib as a new treatment option for adults with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, and we will work with the FDA to determine a path forward to ultimately bring baricitinib to patients in the U.S
And as I'll discuss in more detail later, we had a positive Phase 3 read-out for abemaciclib, for Taltz and for Cyramza
Finally, on deploying capital to create value, we completed the acquisition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals, which adds lasmiditan for acute migraine to our late-stage pipeline
And we returned over $500 million to shareholders via our dividend
Our continued progress in 2017 keeps us on track to achieve our mid-term goals for each of our strategic objectives
Now let's go to slide five for a more detailed review of the key events that occurred since our last earnings call
On the commercial front, here in the U.S
in collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim we launched Synjardy XR, a once-daily combination tablet containing empagliflozin and extended-release metformin for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes
As I mentioned earlier, we launched Olumiant in Europe for the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, following European Commission approval earlier this year
On the regulatory front, U.S
FDA issued a complete response letter for baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis
The letter indicated that the FDA was unable to approve the application in its current form
Specifically, the FDA indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate doses and to further characterize safety concerns
Lilly and Incyte disagree with the Agency's conclusion, and we look forward to meeting with the FDA in the coming months to determine appropriate next steps
We'll provide you status updates after we meet with the FDA
, the FDA approved an update to the Trulicity label to include use in combination with basal insulin for adults with type 2 diabetes
And in Europe, along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we received European Commission approval of an update to the Synjardy label to include a change to the indication statement as well as data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial on the reduction of cardiovascular death
On the clinical front, we announced that MONARCH 2 is a Phase 3 trial of abemaciclib in combination with fulvestrant in women with HR+ and HER2- breast cancer met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival
We look forward to presenting data from this study at ASCO in early June
And we'll hold a call the evening of Saturday, June 3 to discuss these results with the investment community
Finally, we've decided to move the FDA submission of MONARCH 2 from the previously announced timing of Q3 up in to Q2. And just yesterday we announced that the MONARCH 3 study with abemaciclib met its primary endpoint at an interim analysis, demonstrating that women with HR+, HER2- advanced breast cancer who had not received prior systemic therapy experienced a statistically significant improvement in PFS with treatment with abemaciclib plus an aromatase inhibitor compared to placebo plus an aromatase inhibitor
The improvement was also shown in a key secondary endpoint of objective response rate
We intend to begin global regulatory submissions of these results in Q3 2017. For the RAINFALL study of ramucirumab in first-line gastric cancer, the independent data monitoring committee recently met to review the primary analysis
While we remain blinded to the data, we're pleased to report that the IBMC stated that the study met its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival
Consistent with our prior communications, our expectation remains that regulatory submissions could occur after we have the final overall survival data in 2018. At the American Academy of Dermatology Meeting, we presented Phase 3 data showing that patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with ixekizumab, or Taltz, demonstrated superior efficacy at 24 weeks compared to patients treated with Stelara
And along with Boehringer Ingelheim, we initiated two Phase 3 studies of Jardiance for the treatment of chronic heart failure
These trials will enroll patients with and without diabetes and with both preserved as well as reduced ejection fraction heart failure
Moving to slide six
As I mentioned earlier in business development news, we completed the addition of CoLucid Pharmaceuticals
In other news, in Japan, the IP High Court ruled in our favor in the invalidation trials initiated by Sawai regarding our vitamin regimen patents for Alimta
If the patents are ultimately upheld through all the challenges, they could provide intellectual property protection for Alimta in Japan until June of 2021. To support the increased demand for our products in our pipeline, we announced plans to invest $850 million in our U.S
operations in 2017, including research laboratories, manufacturing facilities and some administrative areas
We also distributed over $500 million to shareholders via the dividend
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil for a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter
Thanks, John
Well, I think we've addressed this question before, but just to reiterate
Basaglar is a great fit for us because we already have an asset base to make the product, we have a commercial investment that can sell the product and we have devices that are world-class that the product goes in
So it's really a drop-in to a broader insulin play and rounds out an important part of the portfolio we weren't participating in, which is the innovative basal segment, which is obviously a big segment of the diabetes market
But our core strategy in diabetes is to innovate above and beyond the benefits of glargine in basal insulin as it is all other therapies
And that's really the same as our other therapy areas, oncology, immunology
Our main focus is on innovation to beat the standard of care today for something better for patients
If those same dynamics played out for a TNF biosimilar or something else, sure, we'd look at it
When you can get a lot of leverage financially and it tucks into your portfolio, that can make good sense
But we don't have a broad-based division associated with biosimilars work
We're not pursuing that at this moment
I think, Jami, your question is, if I heard it right, is would we undertake some very large cost restructuring programs and sort of make a one-time move in operating margins
Right now, under the scenario we see and per the discussion we also had with Derica today, we see a continuous top-line revenue growth driven by new products
And the kind of performance we put up in Q1, if we just compound that out I think will yield impressive margin gains
Reminding people 7% top line, 3% cost curve, yielding 18% income growth
I think if we compound that over the next several years, you'll be (51:50) top-tier financial performance out of Lilly
Ad that's where we're focused on rather than try to have some disruptive event that would perhaps set us back in terms of revenue growth and our R&D productivity
So right now that's what we're focused on
Of course, we have scenarios, as Derica described, that have different mixes of products that get us to that 5% average top line, some that get us well above it
We're very comfortable with that guidance now
Yeah
It's primarily based on a topline growth, that's right
If you do the math, there are targeted cost reductions, which have been and we'll continue to undertake, to reshape the company and make it as competitive as it needs to be as well as service the R&D engine as well us the launches that are underway
Well, our posture on M&A really hasn't changed
It's a top priority for deployment of capital
Of course, we are very interested in targets that would enhance our position, whether it be pipeline or otherwise, in oncology, in diabetes, in immunology or in Alzheimer's or pain
When we've seen those things, we've moved quickly
I think CoLucid is an example of that
The reality in the world, though, is, I think, that there are constraints
And one of them is pricing
We're not the only company looking for these assets
The other is strategic fit
We're going to be disciplined to stick to therapeutic areas where we have an ongoing interest
We think this is where we have information advantage and we want to trade on that
And then I think the asset fit within our pipeline, when we're talking about pipeline assets, we seek to acquire things that can be producing interesting combinations or fill gaps
So we're very focused on this space
Obviously, we had one transaction in Q1. I hope we can find more like it because we see a lot of value in CoLucid as an example
It's a top priority for me and we continue to scour the planet for good opportunities to add to Lilly's growth story
And just as a reminder, the R&D study just had the four milligram in it against Humira
So I think if that's your question, just remind the group that that was the only dose studied in that particular (1:10:10) analysis
Yeah, and just briefly on baricitinib
You're correct in saying that the program had a number of step ups after the initial placebo-controlled phases
So many patients moved from two to four milligrams or placebo to four (1:21:50) standard in RA studies
And we also in the long-term study everyone rolled into, we had a step-down feature
So we have a lot of data about two versus four, and we look forward to talking to the FDA more about that data in the coming weeks and days
We participate your participation in today's earnings call and interest in the Eli Lilly & Company
As we've discussed before, Lilly is entering a period of growth driven by new product launches
The diversity in our portfolio, our top-line growth prospect and the opportunity for margin expansions over the balance of the decade provide a compelling thesis for investors
I look forward to our continued interactions and keep you informed of our progress
Please follow up with our IR team if you have any questions we didn't address today
