Thank you, Mark, and we appreciate your joining us for the call today
So let's get right to the key points
In spite of aggregate shipments in the quarter being hit hard by a rough weather across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, and by specific circumstances in Illinois and Coastal Texas, our unit margins in Aggregates reached a second-quarter record, and the pricing climate remains positive
In addition, our visibility to a turn in public construction activity continued to improve
There are more highway project tons in backlog than we've seen in at least three years
Private non-residential starts in our markets are now growing
They've gone from plus 1% a year ago to plus 8% today
In both highways and private non-res, our markets are outperforming non-Vulcan served markets in starts growth
In addition, highway starts in Vulcan markets are up 7%
Although we have lowered our outlook for aggregate shipments in this calendar year, we see the second half of 2017 returning to growth
The shortfall in aggregates volumes drove most of the gap between our reported results and expectations for the quarter
Shipment results are highly variable across geographies just like you'd expect given the dynamics I mentioned earlier
For example, shipments for Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were down 12% compared to the prior-year second quarter, well off trends and expectation
This was largely due to weather and its impact on project timing
At the same time, Illinois and Coastal Texas shipments were down 19% and 12% respectively
This was driven by severe reductions in large project work
Yet our backlogs in coastal Texas and Illinois, like most of our markets are very strong and growing
Our other markets combined saw shipment growth of over 6%
This is much more in line with expectation and trend
This growth came despite very tough weather in the East, with the West showing very strong shipments, as expected
It is important to note that the factors negatively impacting second quarter shipments are contradicted by strong underlying demand trends
In fact, looking behind the quarter's reported numbers, I'm very encouraged by what I see
Leading indicators for shipments continue to strengthen, with public construction beginning to exit from the lull experienced over the last 12 months
Private demand continues to recover across most of our footprint, with key states such as California and Virginia showing renewed momentum
Long-term project pipelines for both private and public transportation work continue to build
And now, we're seeing the rate of starts for transportation infrastructure projects returning to growth
A year ago, these starts for Vulcan markets were down 16% on a trailing 12-month basis
This led to a drag on our shipments
Today they're up 7%, and we're seeing meaningful improvements in our backlogs in markets ranging from California to Illinois to Georgia
Customer confidence remains very strong given this visibility, and the pricing climate remains positive
Pricing for the quarter was up about 6%, taking into account product and geographic mix
On a normalized basis, our cash margin per ton in aggregates improved by 7%
Now, this is despite wet material, which is hard to process; on-again, off-again production schedules; and expensive production splits
To give you a better feel for the quarter, I'll briefly compare and contrast two of our important states, California and Georgia
They illustrate clearly the variability in the quarter, but also the quality of the profit improvement that we're seeing at the local level
In California, we saw volume improve by 10%
This is the beginning of the recovery we saw coming in 2016. Pricing improved by 7%, and overall unit profitability improved by 49%
This is consistent with the strong operating leverage that we enjoy
This California growth reflects a strong and strengthening private market, and this is before we feel the impact of additional state and local highway funding of approximately $6 billion per year
This will drive dramatic improvement in the public market
In California, we are also a major supplier to massive projects like the new Rams stadium, which was delayed slightly in the first quarter and has now begun shipping
Now to Georgia
For those of you close to the industry, you know Georgia is a strong market
However, in the quarter things slowed down considerably due to DoT delayed projects and weather
For example
Atlanta had 25 rain days in May and June
These factors contributed to a volume decline of 13%
But I'm not worried about Georgia, Georgia is going to be fine
The fundamental demand outlook remains solid
It is supported by both private construction activity and a defined slate of public transportation projects
Pricing for the quarter in Georgia rose a healthy 8%
This is a strong sign of underlying demand strength
We lowered our volume expectations for the year, which lowered our guidance range
This is due to compression of shipping days and the timing of large projects that we know are going to ship
In addition, I'm very pleased by our growing project backlogs, growing public and private starts, and the growing preconstruction pipeline
We feel confident that we will return in the second half of the year to a sustained period of growth
To underscore the point, the backlog of large projects in Georgia where Vulcan will be the major supplier continues to swell
Big highway projects like the I-75/16 work in Macon and the I-285/400 expansion in Atlanta have been delayed by the DOT as well as by weather
But they will start to ship soon
Now I'll hand it off to John, who will walk you through the details of the quarter and discuss outlook and financing activities
Thanks, John
Now despite the volume shortfall, and our revised outlook for the full year, I'm very encouraged by the way many key indicators improved during the quarter, and by what that foreshadows for the second half of 2017 into 2018 and beyond
This time last year, California and Virginia were relatively soft
Now they are demonstrating renewed momentum
Coastal Texas, although weak so far this year, should begin to deliver on a solid backlog of work as delayed projects kick off later this year
And we remain very confident about the Southeast, given continued growth in both public and private demand
Public transportation projects starts returned to positive territory
The pricing climate remains very positive
Our customers are confident, and our recent acquisitions have performed well so far
Now, speaking of acquisitions, I want to comment briefly on our progress related to the Aggregates USA acquisition, and also in general about the M&A market
Regarding Aggregates USA, we are on track with this important acquisition, and the more we learn the more excited we become
Their management team and workforce are outstanding, and the synergies are all there and work well for us
This transaction is the one that checks all the boxes
Operational synergies will include plant efficiencies due to balancing product mix
We will have cost synergies for managing our rail fleet more efficiently
We will serve new customers and serve our existing customers in different ways, with the right product at the right time and at the right place
We are also obviously – we obviously also have back-office synergy
And lastly, we realize that in any acquisition, we have great opportunities to learn from the new business and its people
We continue to evaluate a number of bolt-on M&A opportunities
The M&A environment is rich right now, but we will stay disciplined, and that means staying focused on the types of synergies that I just described
And now, we'll be happy to take your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Bob
I'd describe the pricing environment right now kind of two words and that's vision and confidence
I think our customers see – they know the backlogs, the work they have, they see the work is coming
There's going to be a lot of pent-up demand
And so, it's a very good environment for pricing because of that
Now, I think that with some of the hard-to-produce products, asphalt sizes that are hard to produce and more expensive to produce, you may see prices go up faster and higher, particularly over the next year or two, particularly due to the rising highway demand and asphalt – demand on asphalt sizes
But people really understand the work that's out there, Bob, and they know it's coming
So, they have a lot of ability to increase prices, all the way through the construction materials group
Yeah, I'd add, John, I'd add to that, if you look step back and look at our operating people's performance in the quarter, they did a great job under tough circumstances – really tough circumstances
First of all, their safety performance was much improved
Our accidents went down 20%, reportable accidents, and our lost time accidents went down 35%
So a great job on that, they're really taking care of each other, and that's taking care of business
John said it best, when it comes to cost, the biggest impact was weather, and it was impact for the volume of weather and fixed-cost absorption
And then wet weather, as John said, you're starting and stopping plants, that's really inefficient, and it just slows you down
It's just harder to run sloppy material
And so we did the best we could with that, under the circumstances
And again, this is weather where it rains every other day, and that's just tough to work out of
And then we're also producing a higher percentage of asphalt sizes right now, and this is because of the visibility we have of all the highway work, and they're just smaller size, and they're just slower and harder to produce and more expensive to produce
But I think our ops teams continue to work hard to really work on their operating efficiencies, and it's obvious they're protecting each other, which is incredibly important
Thanks, Bob
Hi, good morning, Jerry
I think, if you look at where we stand from a demand perspective, and what's happened in the markets and I'd – it's all really good
The one place it may be a little soft is non-highway infrastructure and I'll come – Illinois – but I'll come back to those
So I'll start in the Mid-Atlantic
If you look at Virginia, we saw – have seen non – our volumes actually went up in the second quarter, despite tough weather; non-res has come back, housing's been healthy, highway continues to be healthy, we have good backlogs there
Looking at Tennessee, Tennessee is a very healthy state and a little bit of a drag on highways, but that will fix, rectify itself with new funding, and the Tennessee DOT is trying to accelerate that spending, but it always takes a little time
Carolinas continue to be healthy, both public side and the private side and that's before we see flow-through of funding in South Carolina
Georgia, as we say, is a very, very healthy market on all ends, and we have massive highway work coming in Georgia, to the tune of – I could name six large jobs that we have secured that total 8 million tons of shipments
It's just a matter of when they ship
Florida, continues to be good, both on the public side and on the private highway side
Alabama has been a little slow, it's actually growing on the private side, public's a little slow
If you look at the coastal market, growing
Move to Texas, and we've called out coastal Texas and we'll see some big work flow through in coastal Texas, probably fourth quarter
We expected those to ship, both energy projects and highway projects, second quarter; they just got pushed back because of permitting on land, a number of issues
North Texas and Central Texas continue to be very healthy
We saw good growth in the second quarter in both of those
Arizona and New Mexico, while the private's been healthy, the highway work is really flowing through in those markets, and we'll get two pluses there because we're a big aggregates supplier and asphalt supplier, and our backlogs there are probably at records from highway work
California has been a great story for us in the second quarter
We saw the price really driven by the private side
Private non-res has really flowed through there
Housing continues to be healthy
We see a little bit of pick-up in highway work, and remember now, in California, we are the largest supplier of aggregates and the largest supplier of asphalt, and we're in all the metropolitan markets, and this is before SB 1 flows through
Illinois is a challenge
It's just going to be a challenge
The public side is tough
Believe it or not, we do see growth on res in Illinois, and we will see some bigger work that we have backlogged in Illinois flow through over the next 12 to 18 months
So if you just step back and look at the picture and get past the weather in the second quarter, this is a really, really good market
The starts have grown and the pre-construction pipeline is growing, both on the private side and now on the public side, and again, this is before we see flow-through of a lot of the new state highway funding
So as you step back and look at this, as I said in my opening remarks, we're very encouraged
There's you question
No, we've seen no flow-though
Remember, those funds don't start getting collected until November
Now, the state has been talked about as it's trying to accelerate that, they'll let 13 jobs this year, and then they're scheduled to let another 50 jobs, pending permitting and design
You'll see some work flow through, and a little bit flow through in 2018 maybe, and maybe some paving work or repair work, but the big work always takes 18 months to 24 months to really get going
So – and we just always, we want it to come through faster, there's a lot of promises to come through faster, but it's just tough to do
So I would tell you the earliest that'll be 2018, but it's really going to flow into 2019 and 2020 and beyond
So it's like I said, we're always disappointed it takes longer, but the work's coming and it is absolutely needed in that state
Good morning, Kathryn
First of all, the healthiest market in California right now is Southern California
And we're seeing – we've seen, in California, residential growth be healthy for a long time now, and it continues to grow
One of the big differences is non-res, particularly in Southern California, and as we saw in the preconstruction pipelines a year ago, and we talked about it's going to flow through, and it continues to build
So very exciting to Southern California on the private side
Northern California has been a little slower on the non-res
Res continues to be healthy, but the pipeline is growing, and it will flow through
As you remember, we had a lull in, or a dip in state funding a little better than a year ago with some budget issues, they came back and put some funds back in
And so we're starting to see that growth, and we know that they're trying to accelerate the funding
So I'd describe Southern California as a little ahead
Northern California, it will come, and is following and the preconstruction, pipeline is filling on both
Just, like I said, Southern is little bit faster
Now, as you saw in our numbers and you continue to see, with this visibility and the confidence and the jobs that are out there and what's coming, there is really good pricing momentum in California
We feel like, from a capacity standpoint, both in aggregates and in asphalt, we're physically in a great position, and ability to serve the market, we're in the best position
I would add one thing on, this is not the market, but our operating folks in California have done – made big improvements in the last year on operating efficiencies and synergies, and I've got to give them a real hand of – or applaud them for what they've done, and I think that will continue and only get better
No, I think, the fundamentals in Coastal Texas are all there
I know you've got employment growth, you've got population growth
We've seen the residential side come back
Non-res has been kind of flat but starting to improve
Our real issue has been timing of projects, and it's both highway projects and energy projects that we thought we had slated to start in the first half of 2017, and they're probably pushed to the fourth quarter of 2017. I'll give you some color on it, I'll give you some color
There's the Golden Pass LNG project and Sabine Pass, we thought would ship in 2017; it's actually got pushed back, it will not let until early 2018. Port of Freeport expansion has been pushed back by design, Chevron Phillips refinery upgrade was delayed
We saw State Highway 550, which is actually in the valley, we had environmental and permitting issues
And then the SH 288 Highway, which we thought would ship I guess second quarter, it got pushed back a little bit
So from our perspective, it's really timing of large work
I think that as I said earlier, the fundamentals are there, and I think that that is a market that is returning and getting a lot better, to your point
I think that's one we'll have to wait and see
There will be some pressures on them, and tension there
We're hoping that they can get that all out and permitted and designed and in place, but as always with larger projects, it becomes – the time constraints could become more difficult
They are just more complex to design, you've got bigger permitting issues, you've got bigger right-of-way and land issues
So – and we're seeing that across all DOTs, particularly Texas, but you're starting to see a big increase of large projects
And the good news for us is, whether it's Texas or anyplace else, that's right in our wheelhouse
We've got a lot of those backlogged, but there's a high percentage of those that we're just seeing take longer from when they start
And we've got a number of them started in 2016 and we're still not shipping rock, and it's a variety of complex designs, it's right-of-ways, it's permitting; some of it's obviously weather in the second quarter
But I'm not – I guess, I'm not worried about this, because the work's there, it's funded and it is coming
Just large projects are more complex and take longer, but once they go, we ship a better mix of product, and they go fast
Yeah
Embedded in guidance, we've got a number of them that are starting to ship
We saw some ship a little bit in July, and they'll come on in August and September
And as I talked about Texas, we'll see some starting in the fourth quarter, I hope
But it is leveling out
I think we – and do not underestimate the impact of raining more than 50% of the time in May and June
It's not just DOT designs and right-of-way
When you have rain 15 days out of a month or 14 days out of a month, and it's spread out, the contractors just can't get on the job
And any day that we can cobble together four or five dry days, we see our shipments jump up all over the place
So the work's there, and it's going to come, but it – so I think that we feel good, and our outlook for the second quarter of the work that's going to start, we have good visibility to that and have good contact with the contractors
And the good news is, the work's there
Oh, yeah
I think from Vulcan's perspective, we're okay, and we continue to add, and we – both quality of employees and quantity of the employees
From our customers' perspective, and John said it very well a minute ago, on the large highway work, that's not going to be a big constraint
And those folks are really putting in on and prepared, because they have visibility to what's coming and they have time to do that, and that's going to continue to flow through
Now, there will be, on concrete work, probably more pressures, and I think those, our customers are working hard to address drivers and finishers and framers
But it will be a natural tension, probably a little more short-term than long-term, and it will come and go
But I think long term it won't be a bottleneck, it will be just be some tension
Well, they see what's coming and they've got bigger backlogs
Yeah, I would summarize product mix in the second half as probably normal
But you'll have two offsetting pressures
The new projects will take a higher percentage of fines and base, and that's really good for us
The flip side of that is you've got a lot asphalt backlog out there, with big highway work, and also non-res and the res will take lot of concrete work
So rising waters in both of the different sizes there, so I would tell you normalized
Thank you
I would also add to that that, in a lot of places that's before the big funding flows through
If you look at South Carolina or Tennessee or California, that – we haven't touch that, and so, more to come
I think as John said, it really boils down in 2017 to the number of shipping days we have left that works there
And so whatever doesn't happen in 2017 is obviously not going to go away
We see growing how we starts, we see growing private starts, and the pipeline of preconstruction continues to fill
So while we feel good about the end of 2017, or the second half of 2017, I think we feel very good about 2018, 2019 and 2020, because like I said, the private side continues to be healthy and you've got very much a growing public side
I think it's a function of what's happening out there in the market from a demand, and as I always say the visibility and confidence
And if you look at what goes on, particularly in the private sector, which is very healthy, continuing to grow and well below kind of normalized levels, and then as, again, you put on top of that what's happening from a highway perspective, yeah, prices – the pricing climb will be healthy for years to come
Yeah
I think, if you step back and look at res in our markets, demand's up high single-digits
But Single Family is up much higher, it's up double-digit, and really the driver right now
And that growth is supported by subdivision development and construction, really with smaller homes and it's affecting a lot of first-time buyers and younger buyers
And if you look at demographics that's really good, because there's a lot of them out there
So – and the good news about that is, that kind of construction is very aggregate-intensive, both with new subdivisions and a lot of houses
So we're pleased with the res, and it is broad based across our footprint
It's hard to find a market that doesn't have good healthy residential growth
Yeah
I think July is easy to explain, the first two weeks it rained, the second two weeks we put a lot of work together
And the second two weeks were very healthy
So – and again, as we said, in lot of these cities we had 10 days of rain in July and still went up 2%
I think the answer to that question is no, it's not an impact
The FAST Act's secure and we're seeing those funds flow through
It's been very good for us
I don't think a lot of it's hit yet
And remember, that passed in November of 2015, takes – again, it takes 18 to 24 months to flow through
But I think we're secure about that
I think what everybody's working on right now is what we do three or four years from now
And I think there's a lot of momentum in D
to address the Highway Trust Fund
Both parties want this to happen
It's not a matter, again you hear us say this a lot, it's not a matter of if, but when and how
We saw back in the summer 200 members of congress sign a letter to fix the trust fund
So I think it's going to be addressed, but I don't see any threats to federal funding at this point
Yeah
Our volumes were up in all of our concrete markets
The big margin improvement came in Northern Virginia and Texas, California is – which is new to us – performed very well
We're very pleased with that
I think overall we're very pleased with our concrete performance, and I think that the teams out there have done a really good job of executing, both on servicing our customers and on being efficient from an operating cost perspective
I think the – right now, IDOT is just in tough shape
The public sector's been hit hard, you've had no state budget for two years; the DOT stopped work temporarily in the second quarter, we've seen them crank it back up
From our perspective, we've got better backlogs than we've had
Our backlogs are growing in Illinois
We've got some big jobs that were delayed, particularly O'Hare runway
If you step back and look at Illinois and remember demand is driven by population, and Chicago is not going away and they'll have to fix their problems
And again, this is one of those that's not if they're going to fix it, but when they're going to fix it and how
So – and our position in Illinois is very good
I think under very difficult circumstances, our teams in Illinois have done a very good job maximizing profitability and being efficient and servicing customers
So while it's tough right now, we do think it's – in the long term, and remember this is a long-term business, that long term, it will be a solid market and we have the premier position in Chicago
So while it's tough, again it's a long-term business, and we're in for the long haul
We've had actually decent price increases in Illinois, and we've upped our game on servicing our customers, and position is important and we're getting paid for it
To answer your question, we're still in the process with the DOJ, and that's a normal process and it's going along
But it's way too early to try to speculate on what we have to divest or where, what and when
But I would say this much, as we get into that project and into that acquisition and look at the quality of it, and as I said in my opening comments, we're really excited about it
This is a very good business, it has very strong assets, great positions, great reserves, and their people are very professional and very good
So we're – while we're going through the process, and as – which is normal – I think the more we spend time with this, the more excited we are about welcoming this into the Vulcan family
I think it may be both
I think you see some of both with that
Thank you for your time that you spent with us this morning
As you can tell, John and I, and I'd say the rest of our Vulcan family, are very excited about our business, our growing pipeline of work, our growing project starts, our backlogs are up, both on the private and the public side
And I think our people are working really hard every day to improve our business
So these are exciting times
We look forward to sharing more information with you over the quarter, and talking to you again at the end of third quarter
Again, thank you for your interest in Vulcan Materials
