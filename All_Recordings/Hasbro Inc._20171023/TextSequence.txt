Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today
The Hasbro team delivered a very good third quarter, the highest revenue and earnings quarter in our history
We’ve positioned Hasbro to unlock the full potential of our brands, investing significantly across the brand blueprint
We're still in the early stages of realizing our ambition
During this quarter, we demonstrated our strategy's ability to deliver growth amid challenging conditions, across a number of dimensions
Revenues grew in each operating segment with double-digit consumer takeaway globally at retail
Franchise Brands, Hasbro Gaming, and Emerging Brands revenues increased led by growth in NERF, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, MONOPOLY, BABY ALIVE, FURREAL FRIENDS, SPEAK OUT, and TWISTER
Our commercial and finance teams are effectively managing the short-term disruption from the Toys "R" Us restructuring and bankruptcy filing in the U.S and Canada, as well as ongoing softness in the U.K and Brazil
And our investments in our multi-screen content to commerce and omni-channel retail strategies are building deeper consumer engagement across multiple brand experiences as evidenced by the growth in TRANSFORMERS and MY LITTLE PONY
The industry data supports our success
And through August, Hasbro ranked first in the G11 toy and game markets according to industry sources
Hasbro revenues grew in developed economies including the U.S
, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico, and Australia
Emerging market revenues increased 8% with growth in China and Russia, as well as from our new operations in India
As we discussed last quarter, the U.K and Brazil continued to face tough economic conditions and we forecast that to continue in the near-term
Our diverse geographic and brand portfolio positions us to overcome these challenges with strength in other major markets
In addition, over the past several years, our global commercial teams have invested in an omni-channel retail strategy, which puts Hasbro where consumers are shopping not just at mass and toy specialty, but importantly in e-commerce where consumer take away continues to outpace total point-of-sale, as well as in emerging channels including value, grocery, and drug, new feature shops at retailers, fan and specialty retail
While the near-term impact of Toys "R" Us is disruptive, and we paused shipments for a short period as we gain clarity on the situation
We are working with them as we enter the holiday period
This doesn't impact our outlook for overall consumer takeaway, which has continued to be strong, but does introduce higher uncertainty as to the level of shipments to them in the fourth quarter
Importantly, we're also well positioned in new and growing channels with the wealth of retail options, in store, online, and omni-channel, we're confident in the collective long-term outlook for the retail landscape
For the third quarter, Hasbro's Franchise Brand revenues increased 7% with growth in NERF, TRANSFORMERS, MY LITTLE PONY, and MONOPOLY
Hasbro Gaming increased 22% and Emerging Brands were up 9%
NERF has posted double-digit growth throughout 2017 and Q3 was no exception
Global POS was up in the mid to high teens for the quarter, increasing in all regions
NERF Nitro launched and is off to a good start
TRANSFORMERS multi screen entertainment continued to drive revenue growth in the franchise
Point-of-sale was up versus last year and up versus the last movie year
This fall, we continue with new entertainment initiatives to engage our fans
The global home entertainment release of Transformers: The last Knight took place on September 28 and all new episodes of Robots in Disguise and RESCUE BOTS are running on linear and streamed services
In addition, in partnership with Machinima, in November we're debuting the second chapter of the critically acclaimed digital animated series Prime Wars Trilogies: TITANS RETURN
We see every day that brands backed by multi format stories combined with merchandise based on robust investment in innovation, deliver engaging experiences for consumers, fans, and audiences
Consumer insights, storytelling, and content remain an integral part of creating successful sustainable brand franchises and Hasbro is building industry-leading expertise
My Little Pony revenue increased behind the release of MY LITTLE PONY: THE MOVIE and successfully drove point-of-sale gains around the movie debut
Our content to commerce model delivers multiple revenue streams, including entertainment and merchandise, and we are well positioned in our investment
The film was successful in reinvigorating and energizing our core consumer base and our fan base, while inviting new fans into the brand
The film is yet to be released in a number of international markets and will be followed by the Home Entertainment window, an important element of expanding the audience
MONOPOLY revenues were up with several new games, including the Token Madness edition as well as MONOPOLY Gamer, featuring Nintendo characters and new game play
As expected, MAGIC: THE GATHERING revenues declined in the quarter, while play numbers remained high and sentiment from players and stores is positive
Our new digital gaming initiative MAGIC: THE GATHERING arena was announced on September 7 and will go into close beta in November
MAGIC: THE GATHERING franchise remains strong and our investments in its content, storytelling, and digital platform will continue as we believe there remains significant future potential for the franchise
Hasbro Gaming revenues grew 22% and consumer takeaway increased at a similar level
Gaming growth continued across multiple formats and our expertise in gaming coupled with our ability to translate social trends into commercial gaming experiences is driving growth around the world
Partner brand revenues decreased led by declines in YOKAI WATCH as well as DREAMWORKS' TROLLS, which was down versus last year's third quarter launch of movie product
Point-of-sale for the category was up, including gains in MARVEL, DISNEY PRINCESS, and DISNEY DESCENDANTS, DREAMWORKS' TROLLS and Sesame Street
Trolls is performing well this year and we look forward to the upcoming entertainment DREAMWORKS' TROLLS Holiday airing November 24 on NBC
STAR WARS revenue increased in the quarter with robust global retail support of STAR WARS: The Last Jedi merchandise released on September 1. We anticipate consumer interest building as promotional activities increase and we get closer to the film launch date
The multi-year entertainment slate for STAR WARS has created a larger, more sustainable level of business for this top industry property
Today's entertainment cadence enables a higher, more repeatable level of sales versus historical periods when revenues will decline significantly in years without theatrical entertainment
Beyblade is now available in all regions and contributing to year-over-year revenue gains
Europe and Latin America launched in the quarter and both off to a good start
We continued to release new waves of Beyblade, top supporting ongoing innovation in the line
Hasbro's portfolio of Marvel toy lines saw consumer momentum in the third quarter behind the theatrical release of Marvel Studios Spider-Man: Homecoming, as well as the home entertainment release of Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2 with especially strong brand momentum in our Marvel Legends segment across Marvel franchises, as well as SPIDER-MAN role-play items
We also have a new line supporting the November 3 theatrical release of Thor: Ragnarok
In 2018, Marvel has eight theatrical films, including Marvel Studios Black Panther in February, and Marvel Studios Avengers: Infinity War slated for release in May
Disney Princess And Disney Descendants consumer takeaway increased behind strength in Moana and new Descendants 2 entertainment
In addition, Hasbro's new line in support of Disney's new holiday featurette Olaf's Frozen Adventure is now at retail ahead of the limited theatrical release in front of Disney/Pixar's Coco on November 22. Finally, from September 8 to 10, we hosted our first ever HASCON in Providence, three days of hands-on brand experiences, meet and greets, sneak peeks, and fan-centric events for families and fans of all ages
This first of a kind event is emblematic of our journey from a toy and game company to a global play and entertainment leader, delivering immersive entertainment experiences around our brands
To conclude, I want to reassure you that our brands and global POS are strong through today
Our growth plans for the holiday had been impacted by recent events at Toys "R" Us as well as the economic outlook in certain countries
As a result, we currently expect fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 4% to 7% year-over-year
This is a shift from our prior expectation, but reflects our current shipment plans for the next 60 days
Consumer momentum continues to drive our business and we are well positioned with a diverse in demand brand portfolio to deliver growth for 2017 and beyond
I’d now like to turn the call over to Deb
Deb?
Thank you
Good morning, Mike
The -- as far as the quarter, we did mention earlier that we did have some shipments that we stopped when we heard of Toys "R" Us declaring their bankruptcy, but just for a short period of time
So I would say absent that, the quarter did come in as we expected and absent the bad debt expense
As far as the seasonality, we continue to see that
And with Toys "R" Us just having filed for bankruptcy so late in the third quarter, we've adjusted a bit our thoughts around the fourth quarter
However, we still expect to grow and wanted to just give context around that as well
We found that moving to omni-channel retail strategy has certainly helped and moved a bit more to just-in-time
However, we are about close to 60 days out from year-end now, and we're starting to get more visibility into year-end every day as we get closer and closer
Hi, Mike
So to be clear, I think first and foremost, we do expect to grow more than the industry in Q4 and the industry growth rate estimate now is between 3% and 4%
So we do expect to grow more than that
We've seen great, very strong sell-through up until this weekend
So, that Chapter 11 is just one month old
We've come to agreement on receivables and we also now agreed to terms go forward just over the last few days on our -- over the last month our finance and the Toys "R" Us commercial teams have been working on and focused on getting an agreement which we signed just a few days ago
So now our Toys "R" Us team and the merchants can focus and refocus on the holiday joint business plan with just two months to go
In fact, this wouldn't have been an issue had it happened earlier in the year and it's not an issue for us in 2018. We do have a more expansive retail channel strategy that gives us great confidence that we can deliver industry-leading growth this year even in this environment
We just need to determine what Toys "R" Us can receive over the next few months
But meanwhile it's great to see that our POS is outstanding and very consistent with our expectations
Yes
So year-to-date DISNEY PRINCESS is up and it was also up in the quarter in international markets
Also very heartening to see that point -- the point-of-sale for DISNEY PRINCESS was up quite considerably
In fact, it's among our strongest point-of-sale gainers in the partner brand Arena
So what we’ve really seen throughout the year is great growth around the entertainment initiatives
The entertainment has been a key driver, so Beauty and the Beast and Moana are key drivers of the growth that we've seen year-to-date
And then there's a bit of timing, because you also now are getting into shipments of Frozen around the Q4 featurette, this Olaf's Frozen Adventure
And so, Frozen it was up in the quarter in the U.S
And so again Descendants was very strong in the quarter
So I think it's a bit of timing overall, but we're seeing great robust sales for the brand and particularly strong sales this quarter -- shipments this quarter in international
Yes, so clearly we are assessing what Toys "R" Us can receive, but our expanded retail channel strategy gives us great confidence that we can find home for our inventories, and given where our inventories are and that they’re in great shape and that fact that POS is growing at double digits both globally as well as in the U.S
Both year-to-date and in the quarter we feel very good about where we are and obviously our teams are very focused on a very strong growth rate in the fourth quarter, and we do think we will end up ahead of the industry growth of course
So I would say that, overall, we want -- we can find a home for all the inventory that we have, we don't see that as an issue
But we do need to assess what Toys "R" Us will represent of the total inventories in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter
Yes, so overall for STAR WARS shipments were up in Q3. And we saw that POS was up in the U.S and Latin America, and improving in the other territories and that's just because the way the marketing is just beginning to roll out
We're very encouraged about the long-term opportunity for The Last Jedi
In fact, I think a lot of the impact will happen not just in '17, but as we get into the home entertainment windows that are becoming increasingly important again into spring of 2018. And we're very excited about the new Han Solo movie, Solo: A STAR WARS story
I think that will be great and I don't think it will cut off the tale of The Last Jedi
In fact, I think it really sets us up for a great 2018 for STAR WARS
And then you add to that the fact that we just started to ship The Forces of Destiny product, and we're very excited about that initiative and the content that’s streaming online
And so, I think overall STAR WARS is in pretty good shape now
Obviously, we've come through a couple of quarters where we work through some Rogue One product and feel very good about where we’re heading at this point
Yes, we have
Yes, we have
No, I think that it's a very fluid situation
So as you prepare for earnings which happened to be this Monday and you're working through month-old Chapter 11 situation
We signed an agreement literally very late last week on the go-forward position
I think the teams can return to focusing on our joint business plans, which were in place going into the holidays and Toys "R" Us was performing for us quite well
Our overall business is performing really well
It's just now a matter of refocusing on the holiday
And as I said, had this happened in any other time of the year, we would've had ample time before the holiday period to make a new plan together and do it in a more -- in a longer-term way, but the fact is we feel very good about our overall business
The POS gains that we're seeing across categories are very strong
Our toy and game business POS was up in the high teens
That’s same as true for Franchise Brands, even partner brands were up more than 20%
Our Hasbro Gaming POS was up more than 20%
So, again, we feel very good about the fourth quarter and that we can grow ahead of the industry, But out of an abundance of caution, we did want to highlight that it's a more fluid environment only because of the Toys "R" Us situation, and of course the U.K and Brazil situation
But clearly the bulk of the difference in our point of view was about the Toys "R" Us situation
And just want to now get the teams focused again on a broader retail channel strategy, we go to more doors now than ever before
We see the acceleration in growth in omni-channel and online retailing which is still two or three times stronger than our overall POS gains
So, again, we just provide a range that given the timing of earnings and our focus now on the holiday
Well, even if we shipped less than we would expect, again that's what I was saying that we think there's an opportunity to put our inventory out in the marketplace in a number of places
Obviously, Toys "R" Us has been a growth arena for us, a growth partner for us, and we want to continue to support their initiatives now that we have an agreement in place, we can do that
And so our teams are very focused on continuing the kind of strong growth that we've seen throughout the year, up 7% year-to-date
And so we just give you a range because again as we formulated our look at the earnings picture as of today we felt that our range would be prudent
No, but we did note that we had stopped shipping for a number of days as a result of the bankruptcy
We wanted to get clarity on the situation and we're now shipping Toys "R" Us in all the retail, and again the POS gains are quite considerable against shipments
Well, the movie as of this past weekend globally is just shy of about $40 million
The brand is up in the quarter across every region and across our entertainment and licensing business
We are really building this media digital mix model and our brand blueprint we think is really working
And the film will absolutely pay back its investment
Remember, we made the film for modest budget
It is driving consumer products
It's also driving our digital gaming business and MY LITTLE PONY is up year-to-date
So, again, that combination of storytelling between stream content, television content, and the film is a great formula for the brand
So we feel very good about the brand heading into the holidays in 2018.
You got it
So, look, I think that the MY LITTLE PONY approach is very emblematic of what we're going to do as we go forward, meaning modest investments in film type content, using very strong partnerships and strong investment from a major studio that will pay for the best proportion of our films and distribute those films very effectively and market them globally
So, again, our approach is the television model, stream content model, a digital first model and then modest investments where appropriate in the film model and we're adding capabilities and personnel, people who are professional storytellers in those spaces
As you know we continue to add great capabilities around the blueprint and MY LITTLE PONY and TRANSFORMERS growth are absolutely all about the fact that we're really executing our model quite strongly
You want to talk about the …?
Yes, China's POS growth in the quarter was quite substantial as well as Russia, and our new market in India was quite good as well
So, Brazil is really the one exception within emerging markets and overall emerging markets grew at 8% in the quarter
As we look at games, Steph, you’re absolutely right, the team has done a fantastic job
The social trend games that are about social listening and social scraping and really understanding what's going on in the global market for stream content has really paying dividends, but also our classic games are up and growing through reinvention and reimagination
So, whether it's MONOPOLY that's grown considerably, Fantastic Gymnastics, even Clue Life TWISTER operation, risk, and then of course some of the more -- the fun social games like SPEAK OUT
And then we have a number of new games that are launching in the fourth quarter, including Simon Optix
Hearing Things is off to a great start
Something called Get a Grip, Coinhole, and then of course we just launched our Drop Mix Gaming System, which is very exciting
The reviews have been great and it's just early days, but we feel great about that new music mixing platform as we head into the holidays and into 2018. So the team has done an outstanding job there and I think you will continue to see us use best-in-class digital capability and social media capability to build some fantastic product line up
Yes, look, I wanted to reassure people that our trends of double-digit growth have continued into the quarter
Obviously, we're -- on October 23 we are still seeing great fourth quarter trends through the -- through this past week some great trends and we are seeing it across our business and across regions
And that gives us great confidence and the fact that we can grow beyond industry growth rate and we're at not for this Toys "R" Us situation to have happened in the fourth quarter
We would not be having to talk about the kind of ranges that we're talking about
We just need to get our arms around now the Toys "R" Us situation and obviously, with a broader retail channel strategy with all the omni-channel and online retailing that’s going on and the great growth rates we're seeing there that are two or three times the overall growth rate that we’ve seen in the market
It's quite great
So, for example, in the quarter we saw Franchise Brands grow by in the teens and online we saw Franchise Brands grow by 30%
And that's similar across our business where we’re just seeing this great acceleration both in brick and mortar, omni-channel, and online
So, again, it portends good things for us in the fourth quarter as we're in the fourth quarter and as well into '18.
Yes, I believe that the entertainment lineup for 2018 is actually stronger than 2017. If you think about the opportunity that begins early in the year with Black Panther, an exciting new movie from Marvel Studios, we get into Avengers by May, we have a Han Solo: STAR WARS story movie in the end of May
We have our very own Bumblebee movie that comes in December next year, you’ve got Toy Story 4. You’ve Ant-Man and the Wasp, and then you have Spider-Man animated movie that comes at the end of the year as well, at the end of '18. So the lineup is quite considerable from Marvel, from Lucasfilm, from Hasbro
Of course, we have all kinds of television entertainment that's also going to support all those brands both from Disney as well as Hasbro's own Studios
And so we feel very good about the lineup in '18 and entertainment should continue to be a key driver of our business
Yes, so let me start with MY LITTLE PONY and then Deb can talk about the resins for a second
The way Lionsgate works is they pre-sell the film in a substantial part of the global marketplace
They self distribute in the U.K
, as well as virtually self distribute in Latin America
The rest of the markets they are pre-selling, so you get that recoupment right up front around your production expense
The movie itself, if you take it through the waterfall should be a contributor to the company over time
Obviously, it may not occur in the -- by the fourth quarter this year, because obviously our expenses for producing the movie will hit in the fourth quarter this year, but again, remember it's a modest budget
However, all the streams of income that it's creating, including consumer products are toys and games business
The digital game that’s performing at a very high-level from Budge Studios and new games that are coming we think it's a great model for the brand
And of course we continue with the 7th season of the television that's appearing globally on linear television services as well as in stream services, it's a very strong performer on Netflix and other services
We see this as a very good model for us go forward
Well, we would set our prices accordingly
Yes, exactly
I think we have a grant that’s probably bigger than normal that's maturing in the fourth quarter this year
And when we get to Toy Fair, we will try to lay out what we think our normal quarterly basis will be, but as we think about first quarter I’m thinking about it as the same -- around the same level as the first quarter of this year
You know
I’m so heartened our financing commercial teams have really executed the current plan during the holidays with such excellence
Our belief, as we go forward is that the current situation would not be an issue for us in 2018. I don't know how to answer a hypothetical like the one you post
However, I will tell you that we’ve increasingly found great homes for our great products
Our products sell quite well at a number of different new channels that we've expanded into including value and drug as well as other new retailers
Our mass partnerships as well have really expanded
Our performance with Amazon, our performance with Walmart and Target have been very substantial and very strong
So, again, long-term as you described, our business will be fine and our products will find homes and we will find the consumer, and increasingly we’ve talked about how online continues to dis-intermediate some of the toy departments, and the consumer continues to find our products and it's really heartening to see how online sell-through is even stronger than brick-and-mortar sell-through when there's no friction in the finding of our products
It just says that our products really resonate with consumers
So we said absent the charge which we did not say what it was that our operating profit would have been 100 basis points higher
But if you move up to margin, gross margin and you think about the guidance that we've been giving all year is that we did say we expected our gross margin and our cost of sales actually to be higher than a year-ago, because of the mix of product and also some less favorable hedges that we had in place and it's not that were not hedging
We are hedging to protect pricing and margins, but we've -- it has more buying euros at $1.40, it was a lot more favorable than a euro at what $1.20 today, I didn’t check this morning
But -- so we did say that we expected our cost of sales for the full-year to be a bit higher
When you particularly look at the phasing and our product mix that can have a significant impact on gross margin, and as we had said we did not -- we expected Q3 to be down in MAGIC, and it was, and that did have an impact on our mix for the quarter
Yes, I believe that our operating margin for the full-year can be very similar to the margin that was last year
We just talked about the fact that we would -- prior had expected or more confirmed that we would get some modest growth
Now I would say it's probably more similar to a year-ago, and again we're just talking about 20 basis points of difference
That was -- we were talking about the 15.7% number
So again, I'd expect it to be similar to that this year
Yes, I think the model for MY LITTLE PONY has really worked and I think the team is beginning to think about what our next movie might look like
Meanwhile, we have ongoing television support
The brand, we believe, will halo quite strongly
We're seeing a great reinvigoration of our core fans as well as families and inviting a lot of new fans into the brand around the world
So, we like the model combination of the horizontal of television, the verticals of film for brand like MY LITTLE PONY done well
On the PLAY-DOH side, we’ve seen very strong performance around the PLAY-DOH itself
There have been a few play sets in the spring that have had a weaker performance
Having said that, as we come into the holidays we have some new play sets which are performing early days, very, very good level including our Rapunzel full play set
We also have a number of play sets and something they call Kitchen Creations, which we would expect good performance on
So I think long-term PLAY-DOH has been one of our most global brands
It's one of the most heavily consumed, parents really enjoy and it's definitely a part of children helping to create or enjoy developmental milestones
And so I think long-term I’m very confident in the PLAY-DOH and the PLAY-DOH's teams ability to grow that business over time
Let me talk to STAR WARS and the shift, and Deb you can do the first one
The -- on STAR WARS, clearly it's become a much bigger more consistently big brand year-after-year, and that's what we've really seen
And again this year as we head into The Last Jedi, it's a brand that's up in the quarter and we expect very good things this holiday, but also Gerrick as you were describing, expect very strong spring around the brand
We saw it last time for The FORCE AWAKENS
We've seen it throughout this year for Moana and for Beauty and the Beast
We are seeing it around TRANSFORMERS as the DVD dropped on September 28 and the performance has been quite strong
So I think people are enjoying motion pictures both in the theater as well as through electronic sell-through windows and then into DVD windows
Overall, I think it again says good things about the ability to tell stories and have those stories enjoyed across a multitude of screens
It's really obviously one of the premises of our approach and strategy to be both digitally oriented as well as content oriented
And so, I would expect that to continue and continue for our properties as well as Marvel, Lucasfilm and DISNEY PRINCESS and FROZEN properties
