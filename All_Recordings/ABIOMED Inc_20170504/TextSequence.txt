Thank you, Ingrid
Good morning, everyone
In Q4, Abiomed had another strong quarter of continued adoption of the Impella family of devices with $124.7 million in revenue, representing growth of 33%
patient utilization increased by 30%, driven by continued growth in both Protected PCI and emergent patients, which grew 26% and 37%, respectively
For the full fiscal year 2017, Abiomed generated $445.3 million in revenue, representing a net increase of $116 million or growth of 35%
Abiomed remains one of the fastest-growing GAAP profitable medical device companies and fiscal 2017 was another successful year, as we achieved our corporate goals
We received FDA PMA approval for cardiogenic shock, Impella CP approval for high-risk PCI, IDE approval for our STEMI Door to Unloading study, and approval in Japan
We achieved CMS approval for dedicated DRGs and expanded our clinical evidence to over 400 publications
We ramped up our distribution in the U.S
and Germany and increased manufacturing and training capacity in both Aachen, Germany and Danvers, Massachusetts to meet future demand
We also launched the Abiomed Impella Quality Program that helps improve real-world clinical outcomes with best practice protocols and education, while surpassing 50,000 patients treated in the U.S
Abiomed continues to have a solid balance sheet with a cash position of $277 million and no debt, enhancing our ability to invest in and defend our intellectual property with 274 patents and currently 241 pending
I am proud of our dedicated employees and grateful to our customers and shareholders that have enabled our company to create a new era of medicine, focused on the field of heart recovery
Fiscal 2018 is positioned to be an outstanding year
For today's call, I would like to cover two FY 2018 topics: first, growth in Protected PCI and AMI cardiogenic shock and processes to further improve clinical outcomes; second, provide a brief regulatory update and information on our Japan launch
So, first on Protected PCI and AMI cardiogenic shock
These indications identify new treatments and therapies for cardiovascular care and heart muscle recovery represents a significant unmet clinical need for multiple growing populations
New American Heart Association statistics predict that by year 2035, 45% of the total U.S
population or approximately 131 million people will have at least one health problem related to heart disease and 24 million will have coronary artery disease
Coronary artery disease and heart failure are already the number one cause of death and cost driver in the U.S
These are massive issues for a relatively younger population that exists in every community and need solutions beyond stents, pacemakers and valves
Abiomed is uniquely qualified to help educate physicians on new treatments and therapies to enable complete revascularization and improve patient ejection fraction and quality of life by protecting or recovering heart muscle for elective, urgent or emergent patients
Regardless of the reason for the hospital admission or surgical turndown, many future heart failure patients will require hemodynamic support to stabilize and receive treatment in the cath lab, hybrid lab, EP Lab or surgery suite
Recently, in the AHA journal, Circulation, Dr
Flaherty published a 230-patient retrospective analysis titled hemodynamic support protects against acute kidney injury in patients undergoing high-risk PCI
The paper demonstrated the benefit of Impella support with significant reduction in acute kidney injury and requirement for dialysis
This new study reinforces previously published randomized clinical trial data around Protected PCI
Additionally, at the American College of Cardiology Conference, the first-ever scientific presentation of Abiomed's Impella Quality IQ Assurance Program was presented, including early data from the Detroit Cardiogenic Shock Initiative called CSI
IQ includes nearly all of the 50,000 U.S
commercial patients in an observational database derived from those treated with Impella over the past eight years
This observational data, combined with data collected in the cVAD Registry and FDA studies, creates the largest database in the world for these high-risk patients and helps identify hospitals with the best outcomes
The IQ data indicates that top-performing hospitals achieved a 70% plus survival rate as compared to a 50% historical survival rate for AMI cardiogenic shock patients
Some best practices associated with improved outcomes in survival and heart recovery are reducing inotropic escalation using hemodynamic monitoring and initiating early implementation of Impella before PCI
The Detroit CSI initiative puts into practice these protocols
Detroit CSI is an independent collaboration between five competitive hospitals in Detroit, who are working together to demonstrate improved survival rates with heart recovery
Early data revealed survival rates of approximately 80% with all survivors discharged home with their native hearts
While these initial findings are of a small sample of approximately 40 patients, they correlate with the outcomes from top sites in the IQ Database and the cVAD Registry
These initiatives represent the new goal to achieve survival and heart recovery and emphasize the need for standardized clinically-driven protocols
Overall, we are excited to see improved outcomes at heart recovery hospitals and expect continued adoption of protocols throughout the United States, Germany, and eventually Japan
Additionally, on the CMS front, the American Hospital Association and CMS have now facilitated a system of care around the utilization of percutaneous heart pumps for Impella FDA indications for high-risk PCI, AMI cardiogenic shock, and right ventricular support
Historically, Impella was primarily reimbursed in one category, DRG 216. Over the last 18 months, the AHA Coding Clinic updated Impella to four specific categories: DRG's 216 to 221 for the cath lab, DRG 215 for care in the ICU, DRG 1 and 2 for biventricular support, and DRG's 268 and 269 for transfer of patients to specialized heart recovery hospitals
For my second update, I'd like to highlight that this morning we announced our first patient enrolled in the STEMI DTU feasibility study
This trial will focus on feasibility and safety and lay the groundwork for a future pivotal trial, designed to measure the impact that left ventricular unloading may have on infarct size related to reperfusion injury
We are excited to learn more about this new therapy and how it may impact a 200,000 patient per year population that is currently not treated with Impella or in cardiogenic shock
We are entering fiscal 2018 with incredible momentum
Today, we are announcing that our Impella RP PMA submission has been completed ahead of schedule
And we anticipate approval by October with a planned launch in the U.S
in the second half of our fiscal year
We're very excited to move forward under a PMA
On Japan, we're moving our expectation of MHLW reimbursement to September
Multiple Japanese physician societies work extensively with MHLW to define a guidance document, which outlines the appropriate hospitals and patients that can receive Impella support
This process took longer than we expected
However, we were notified last week that the guidance document has been completed and we have selected our 10 training centers
In conclusion, we're executing on our strategic plan and the Impella platform has a long runway for growth
We are financially secure and operationally prepared to continue to create the field of heart recovery, lead in innovation and grow shareholder value
We want to thank our shareholders for their support and all our employees and customers for their hard work and dedication to our heart recovery mission
As always, we are motivated by meaningfully impacting the lives of our patients
I will now turn the call over to Mike Tomsicek, our CFO
Good morning, Raj
Sure, Raj
So, guidance is guidance and what's possible is what's possible
This is my 52nd earnings call and the 14th time I have forecasted revenue for the year
And we've exceeded expectations in six of the last seven years
So, just to give you an analogy of how I look at it, we're running a marathon right now at a pace and we believe that that pace will allow us to end as a top finisher
And in any given quarter, as we discussed, we can run faster and grow by a few more million because we have so many new products and indications and potential sites
So we continue to be one of the fastest-growing GAAP profitable companies in med-tech, but we're going to maintain our focus on patient outcomes and sustainable growth
And in the end, we'll maintain a pace and maintain our blueprint to ensure our success to $1 billion in U.S
revenue and beyond
So, I mean, that's kind of the way we look at guidance and we're very focused again on making sure that we're growing as the universally adopted standard-of-care in the U.S
, in Germany and soon to be in Japan
Japan is the second largest med-tech market in the world
They really do not do a lot of sternotomies and avoid transplants
So heart muscle recovery is the primary focus and goal for these patients and they have a significant clinical need to do high-risk patients in both the cath lab and EP lab
Therefore, having hemodynamic support will enable a lot more treatment, enable complete revascularization and help many heart attack patients that are going into shock
That being said, Japan is a country where we want to ensure that as we start with 10 centers, we establish the protocols upfront, have the rigor in the training, so that as we expand to other sites in future years we can maintain the pace of sustainable growth with great outcomes and then continue to expand our other products and our other indications into the entire Japanese market
And to remind everyone is we do have the CP
We have the RP which we'll be submitting at some point in the future
And then we also have the world's smallest heart pumps for chronic patients that we're working on that we'll also be bringing longer-term into the future
So we're very focused on launching in Japan the right way, making sure that both PMDA and MHLW are pleased with the way we launch and the way we train the Japanese customers
And we want to again ensure we get the best outcomes we can for Japan
The net effect is that in years two and three that's where we start to see the ramp and the Japanese ramp will look very similar to what we've been doing here in the U.S
for Impella RP
Thanks, Raj
Sure, Danielle
So I think a couple things on the question is we think that the best way to grow Impella is to improve outcomes for patients and that can be for enabling high-risk PCI patients to receive complete revascularization and protection from problems with acute kidney injury or keeping somebody alive after a heart attack that goes into shock and sending them home with their native heart
The strategy comes back to what we've been talking about called the hub-and-spoke execution
And what that means is that we want specialized centers that we would consider heart recovery centers – we would like them to be the leaders in Protected PCI
We would like them to be the hub of the spoke hospitals that are treating patients, but may want to send patients for further support to their facility
And we want all the centers that take patients that are having acute myocardial infarction and potentially who can go into shock have the ability to have Impella support
So in Europe now, you see that the balloon pump is Class III for AMI cardiogenic shock, which means it's harmful
And we've recently seen a trend in a state that in order for a hospital to be considered a trauma center to take AMI shock patients or AMI patients that they need to have some type of strategy for percutaneous hemodynamic support
And as this progresses, our job, as a company, is to support the hospitals and to help them improve their outcomes
And what the Impella IQ Program gives us now is the ability to partner with them to look at best practices and to align the hub-and-spoke, so that the patient can be pre-treated appropriately at the right hospital
And what's exciting is that the American Hospital Association and CMS has now helped us establish basically a systematic payment structure that's based on resources to support patients
So that's why the DRG establishment for the cath lab or the ICU support or biventricular or even transfer from one hospital to the other is very important to our overall strategy
So it's a long answer to your question, but the net effect is that all the sites that are implementing programs are growing
And, again, the specialized hospitals tend to do more of the Protected PCI
But by establishing a network, we can improve outcomes in communities for essentially all of these types of populations
I think the key to success again in growing that is our formula that we've talked about for a while, which is training, data and time
And on the data, the ultimate in data is really having FDA approvals as safe and effective and then having dedicated DRGs for the treatment of these patients is very helpful
So that's standardized
On the training, we continue to train each quarter
We had 16 publications in the quarter
Now we're over 400. We touched almost 1,000 physicians in the quarter for educational programs to symposiums
And on ease-of-use, we continue to make changes and updates to our console and products to ensure that the nurses to the physicians find the implantation and management of an Impella patient easier every time they have an experience
Thanks, Danielle
Chris, thanks for the question
There is two things that we want to highlight
So the first is that we're very pleased that the structure has been established for the multiple types of patients that we have
It's complex in many ways for investors to understand the DRG system, but it's even more complex for Abiomed, because, as you all know, we have multiple types of patients
We have young kids with viruses
We have post-partum cardiomyopathy at times
We have AMI cardiogenic shock for 50-year-old dads
We've got 69-year-olds that have high-risk PCI that are turned down for surgery
And we have patients that have to be treated both just in the cath lab to the ICU to be transferred
And so that part of it over the last 18 months has been sorted out and we're incredibly pleased with the progress we've made
Specifically around the analysis that was done for the proposal for payment for next year for 215, what we have discovered is that it's a very small sample size that was run as a comparison
It did not include our Impella 2.5 and CP populations
And, therefore, we're working with CMS in the comment period to understand why such a small patient population or patient sample dropped significantly and what is the potential alternatives to do that
But what you also have to remember is we now have DRGs for just the cath lab as well as biventricular
So, some of those patients in the past would have – the biventricular patients would have been in 215 and those are now going to be moving to DRG 1 and 2. So I'm very confident what we're going to come up with is a fair plan
And I think what's important for folks to remember is that the DRG system is designed to allow efficient hospitals to breakeven or make a little bit of money
So the better the outcomes, the better the margin for the hospital and this is why our protocols are so important and why we're partnering with hospitals to improve on all the patient populations
Chris, the Impella RP is a product that provides a solution that in many cases can be considered lifesaving
We have patients that are in profound shock and that needs support on the right side as well as the left side
I do believe that the opportunity is significant
And I think with the alignment of biventricular payment at the CMS level, as well as some of the clinical data that has been published or is coming out, it will demonstrate that there is a real clinical benefit for these patients
One of the other nice discoveries that we've made with the Impella RP is that the right side tends to have a thinner muscle wall and therefore is more recoverable
So, therefore, if you can get a patient through the time of injury and risk, the right side usually recovers 100%
And that's very important to send these patients home with their native heart
We will be launching this as a PMA, which is a lot easier than launching under a humanitarian device exemption, which requires every hospital sign in IRB and requires a lot more administrative work
So, I think, things are aligning now with both reimbursement and the regulatory approvals
And we look forward to the second half of the year going from 127 sites today to upwards of 1,000 sites in the future
Good morning, Chris
So, Chris, if I understood you right, you wanted to know – and it was stated in Mike's section that Protected PCI growth was 26% and emergent growth is 37% with overall patient growth at 30%
Is that what you were looking for, Chris?
And that from an RP standpoint, we'll let the regulatory process and the approval take its course
We'' see the exact timing of it
We've guided to October, but then we'll rollout the plan for site qualifications, training and share more specific information as those results come to pass later in the year
But we're not prepared to, sort of not knowing exactly when the approval date will be give you specifics for the year on RP
David, we'll let Abbott update on how they are doing with their own timeline, but this is not a timeline product that has a short leg to it
So you've got multiple tasks to complete
You have to finish the study and then there is again multiple indications required for FDA approvals
Relative to our plan is in 2020 and beyond – we anticipate that at some point we'll have competition
In the short-term, we don't see anything
In the mid-term, we don't see anything that we would consider competitive from an innovative perspective
And our real goal is to obsolete our own products by continuing to advance them, which, later this year, I'll give an outline of some of the new improvements, enhances both for ease-of-use and product performance across the portfolio from the Impella CP with the optical sensor to the ECP product, which I just had a program review in Germany last week, which is a 9 French 4-litre pump
And, of course, we've got the Impella 55 and the Impella BTR coming, which will allow us to enter into that chronic heart failure space for Class III patients
So, we look at ourselves as our biggest competitor
And we're going to continue to innovate
We actually do – we do like having Abbott in the space
They're a good company that focuses on education and they continue to bring more awareness to both Protected PCI and the limitations of the intra-aortic balloon pumps
So, we're excited for well beyond 2020.
Thanks, David
I don't think we've given any specifics on the timing of it
We just said it's not included in our blueprint to $1 billion 2020 plan
But specific to the study itself and the timing is we've projected up to 18 months
So, obviously, if we can do it quicker than 18 months for the enrollment, we will
It is difficult today for just getting IRB approved in general for all med-tech companies
I think you've seen that trends
But once we get all 10 sites then we'll try to be moving as quick as we can
But the component of your question that you touch on is very insightful, because this is a dramatic difference in treating patients today which their hospitals are focused on Door to Balloon time
And that balloon is the angioplasty balloon, which they've shown that if you can open up somebody's coronary artery within 90 minutes, you'll maximize or optimize the ability for these patients to stay alive
The problem with that approach is that we are improving survival, but there is a growing epidemic of heart failure happening, even with the latest and greatest of innovation across the board
And the statistic show that, within five years of someone suffering the first heart attack, 70% have heart failure and 40% of those patients die
Now we believe part of that challenge is because we're treating the plumbing with the coronary approach with stenting-only and there is an effect that's happening with reperfusion injury in apoptosis that is creating more muscle depth
So that's our thesis
And, again, if we end up showing our thesis is true then you're talking about a dramatic change to now Door to Unloading for heart attack patients that today do not get Impella and are not in cardiogenic shock
But we have a long way to go
There is a lot of risk in any study, but we believe the science of the foundation is very solid
And we're definitely excited to potentially enter into a market where we can reduce heart muscle damage in patients that are not yet in cardiogenic shock
Thanks, David
Jayson, the quick answer is yes, because, in the U.S
, you have 1,000 heart hospitals and heart hospitals have sites that have both cath lab and surgical suites and clearly needs right side support or biventricular support
There is an additional 400 hospitals that have cath lab only and we'd agree that for those places not all of them will have it
However, there is also guidelines, Class I recommendations that for sites that are going to do PCI or accept patients that do not have a surgical suite that they need to have a hemodynamic strategy and a transfer policy
So for those sites, they likely would still want to have a biventricular approach to enable a patient to be stabilized and transferred to one of those 1,000 heart hospitals
Last call and what we generally say, it's about 10% of the sites is what we'd consider to have an enforceable standardized protocol
And what that would mean is they've got high-risk PCI
They've got right side support with Impella and that matches up with our RP sites
We have other sites that might have generic protocols, but you have to also understand that some of these hospitals have different physician groups
So while they might have a protocol getting alignment with all of the different centers is somewhat challenging
And that's why the Detroit CSI initiative is so exciting because here you have competitive hospitals with competitive physician groups aligning to say that we are going to create a protocol that we believe not only gets the best survival, but gets the best heart recovery outcome for the patient
And this is very similar to what happened years and years ago with the Door to Balloon time metric
And the Door to Balloon time metric again shows the best outcomes with opening the coronary within 90 minutes
That protocol didn't come about with a randomized study
That came about by physician group studying and looking at real-world evidence to improve outcomes
But just like Door to Balloon time is not effective at 290 minutes, Impella is not effective when a patient has been in cardiogenic shock for two days, three days, has had three inotropes and a balloon pump and they already are in organ failure
So what we're trying to do again is systemically get folks to look at the observational data, as well as the data that's reinforced in the cVAD Registry that shows the best way to improve survival and get the outcome of heart recovery is a formula of reducing inotropic escalation, having hemodynamic monitoring and placing the Impella and stabilizing the patient before you do the PCI
So those are keys to success
And what's nice about the Detroit initiative it's also independent
It's a physician group
We'll continue to work with hospitals with our IQ Program, but the Detroit initiative is driven by the leaders in the space
So, I can formally announce today that our fiber optic sensor on the Impella CP is CE Mark approved
And we'll be launching under a limited release in Germany over the next two quarters
And then we plan to launch in the U.S
at the very end of our year with the Impella CP optical
And to explain again, why it's so important is the optical sensor allows us to have real-time sensing of the location of the Impella pump relative to where it is against the aortic valve; is it above or below, is it in the left ventricle or above the aortic valve
And that's really important to maximize the flow
It's definitely an ease-of-use aspect for patients that are in the ICU. And it will also give us in the future more ways to do smart pumping, so we can actually help wean the patient off and maximize the opportunity of heart muscle recovery
Matt, this is Mike Minogue, and just to add to that
I was in Germany last week
And in the old days, Germany was mostly just the emergency patients
And today we have emergency patients and Protected PCI
So the Protected PCI population now is 30% or more in any given quarter of our patient population in Germany, which is a really important component to our execution and training
The second is an anecdotal story
While I was there in Berlin, I met with one of the top centers
And it is now becoming more obvious to many of the folks and the physicians in heart failure community the importance of heart recovery
And I met with a physician that has been driving heart recovery and works at one of the largest and busiest LVAD centers in all of Europe
There was a patient that had AMI cardiogenic shock, was starting to have organ failure and – but the interventional cardiologist believe the person was recoverable, worked with the surgeons who agreed to give him five days to try to recover the patient
And as the story goes, I actually met the patient
His ejection fraction is now back up above 40%
He had been discharged from the hospital and is bringing a lot of attention to another alternative, another therapy for these kind of patients
And just to remind everyone, in our indication from the FDA, we are given the approval for heart recovery, which means that this is the only technology, the only type of heart pumps that exist in the world that have that exclusive indication
Thank you, everyone, for your time today
If there is any follow-up questions, please reach out to us
Have a great day
