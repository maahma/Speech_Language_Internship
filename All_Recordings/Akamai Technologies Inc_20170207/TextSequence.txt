Thank you, Tom, and good afternoon, everyone
As Tom outlined, Q4 was another strong quarter for Akamai on both the top and bottom lines
Q4 revenue came in above the high end of our guidance range at $616 million, up 6% year-over-year or up 7% adjusted for foreign exchange movements
Revenue was up a healthy 15% if you exclude the six large Internet Platform Customers Tom just mentioned
Revenue growth continued to be solid across the business with the overachievement versus our guidance driven by a higher-than-expected uptick in holiday season traffic with our Media Solutions and customers
I mentioned in our last call that holiday season traffic would play a large role in where we would land relative to our fourth quarter guidance, and it did
Media-related traffic was particularly strong in the quarter
Before I get into the revenue details, please note that all revenue growth rate references will be in constant currency
Revenue from our Media Delivery Solutions was $196 million in the quarter, down 10% year-over-year, but up 8% excluding our large Internet Platform Customers
We saw healthy seasonal traffic growth in both our gaming and software download verticals and continued robust growth in video delivery
Turning to our Performance and Security Solutions, revenue was $367 million in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year
Within the Solution category, we saw solid growth across all major product lines
As Tom mentioned, we have been seeing strong traction with our recently launched Image Manager and Bot Manager solutions, and we have continued to see significant growth and demand for all of our Cloud Security offerings
Fourth quarter revenue for our Cloud Security Solutions was $102 million, up 41% year-over-year, capping off another tremendous year of revenue growth and customer adoption of our security solutions globally
Exiting Q4, our Security business now has an annualized revenue run-rate of over $400 million
We are very pleased with the growth and execution of our Cloud Security business over the past few years
This growth was driven by targeted product innovation and go-to-market resource investments, as well as a very successful acquisition
We plan to maintain this aggressive investment posture to further broaden not only our Cloud Security offerings, but also our Web performance and emerging enterprise solution capabilities where we see substantial long-term growth potential
Finally, revenue from our Services and Support Solutions was $53 million in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year
Turning now to our Q4 customer division results, revenue from our Web Division customers was $300 million, up 14% year-over-year
We continued to see solid growth in this customer base, particularly with our Cloud Security offerings
Revenue from our Media Division customers was $301 million in the quarter, roughly flat year-over-year and up 15% excluding the impact of the six large Internet Platform Customers
This strong growth rate was driven not only by Media Division customers driving more holiday season traffic
but also from upgrading and penetrating more of Akamai's solutions deeper into this customer base
Finally, revenue from our emerging Enterprise and Carrier Division customers was $15 million in the quarter, up 26% year-over-year
Moving on to our geographies, sales in our international markets represented 31% of total revenue in Q4, consistent with the prior quarter
International revenue was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up 19%, driven by continued strong growth in our Asia-Pacific region
Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of just under $2 million on a year-over-year basis and a $6 million impact on a sequential basis as the dollar strengthened significantly through the quarter
Revenue from our U.S
market was $424 million, up 2% year-over-year
If you exclude the large Internet Platform Customers, which are based in the U.S
, revenue growth was a solid 13% across the rest of the business
Moving on to costs, cash gross margin was 77%, up 1 point from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and in-line with our guidance
GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67%, up 2 points from Q3 levels, consistent with the same period last year and a point higher than our guidance due to the strong revenue achievement
GAAP operating expenses were $289 million in the fourth quarter
These GAAP results include depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related charges, and other non-recurring items
Excluding these charges, non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $230 million, up $23 million from Q3 levels
This was above the high-end of our guidance, driven by increased year-end commission costs associated with the revenue overachievement, as well as a significant uptick in litigation spend associated with our Limelight patent infringement cases
Moving in to 2017, we expect to see similar elevated levels of litigation spend
Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $247 million, up $9 million from Q3 levels, and $10 million from the same period last year
Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in at 40%, down 1 point from Q3 levels and from Q4 last year, and in line with our guidance
GAAP depreciation and amortization expenses were $84 million in the fourth quarter
These GAAP results include depreciation associated with stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets and amortization of capitalized interest expense
Excluding these charges, non-GAAP depreciation was $74 million consistent with Q3 levels and at the low end of our guidance due to the timing of some network deployments that shifted into Q1. Non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter was $174 million, up $10 million from Q3 levels and up $6 million from the same period last year
Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 28% consistent with Q3 levels and down 1 point from the same period last year and at the high end of our guidance
Moving on to the other income and expense items, interest income for the fourth quarter was about $4 million, consistent with Q3 levels
Non-cash interest expense related to our convertible debt was roughly $5 million
As a reminder, this non-cash expense is excluded from our non-GAAP results
Moving on to earnings, GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $92 million or $0.52 of earnings per diluted share
Non-GAAP net income was $126 million or $0.72 of earnings per diluted share, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range driven by higher revenues and a slightly lower tax rate
Adjusting for the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in Q4 2015, earnings grew 8% year-over-year
For the quarter, total taxes included in our GAAP earnings were $34 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 27%
Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $50 million based on a Q4 effective tax rate of 28% and coming in about 2 points lower than our guidance due to a higher mix of foreign earnings
For the full year, the 2016 non-GAAP effective tax rate was just above 29%
Finally, our weighted average diluted share count for the fourth quarter was 175 million shares and in line with our guidance
Now I'll review some balance sheet items
Day sales outstanding for the fourth quarter was 54 days, down 2 days from Q3 levels
Capital expenditures in Q4, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense were $78 million and slightly below our guidance for the quarter primarily due to the timing of network buildouts that moved into Q1. For the full year 2016, capital expenditures came in at 14% of revenue and below our long-term model as we grew into our existing capacity from the significant 2015 buildouts
We expect 2017 capital expenditures to be back in line with our long-term model range
Cash flow generation continue to be strong in Q4. Free cash flow was $106 million in the fourth quarter and $550 million for the year or 24% of revenue
Our balance sheet also remains very strong with roughly $1.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at the end of the quarter
If you'll factor in our convertible debt, our net cash is approximately $1 billion
During the quarter we spent $79 million on share repurchases buying back roughly 1.3 million shares
For the year, we spent $374 million buying back approximately 7 million shares
In summary, we are pleased with how the business performed in Q4 and we remain confident in the long-term prospects of growth for the company
Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect to see a normal sequential revenue decline for seasonality, perhaps a bit more pronounced in the recent years due to the particularly strong media performance this past quarter
In addition, we expect further currency headwinds from the strengthening U.S
dollar over the past few months
At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue of just under $4 million sequentially and $5 million compared to Q1 of last year
Factoring in both of these variables, we are expecting Q1 revenue in the range of $596 million to $610 million
At the higher end of this range, year-over-year growth would be 8% constant currency, a slight acceleration from Q4 levels
At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of 76% and GAAP gross margins of 65%
Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $217 million to $222 million, down seasonally from Q4 levels primarily due to less commission spend and fewer customer events
Factoring in the cash gross margin and operating expense expectations I just provided, we anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of 39% to 40%
And as mentioned earlier, we plan to significantly increase our investment levels in 2017 in new product innovation, service delivery enablement and platform scaling â€“ important areas we believe will help us enable to drive accelerated, sustainable long-term growth and scale
And while we're not providing specific guidance beyond Q1 during this call, we want to be transparent about our plans to grow investments throughout 2017 at a faster pace than revenue growth
Our goal is to re-accelerate the top-line growth back into double-digit levels in the longer-term
We are confident the success we have had with our Cloud Security investment strategy can be duplicated in other areas of the business, most notably in our new and emerging Enterprise Solutions portfolio
We also plan to broaden our offerings within our Security, Web Performance and Media Solutions portfolios
This deliberate investment strategy will result in EBITDA margins in the high 30s in 2017 and for the foreseeable future
Moving now to depreciation, we expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $74 million and $76 million
Factoring in this depreciation guidance, we expect non-GAAP operating margins of 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.69. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $48 million to $51 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of just under 29.5%
This guidance also reflects a fully diluted share count of 175 million shares
On CapEx, we expect a significant uptick from recent spending levels in both the first quarter and throughout 2017. This increase is driven partly by some platform deployments that shifted from Q1, but mostly by our desire to continue expanding our secure delivery network and increasing capacity to support our rapidly growing Security business
We expect to spend approximately $90 million and $96 million, excluding equity compensation
It's also worth noting that our planned investment increases in product innovation and scaling our platform will impact CapEx as well as OpEx as we capitalize more R&D development
As such, we expect CapEx spending to return to our long-term model range of 16% to 18% of revenue in 2017. And with the increasing CapEx, you will also see an uptick in depreciation levels throughout 2017. In closing, Akamai accomplished a great deal in 2016, and we remain confident in our ability to execute on our plans for the long term
We look forward to having an opportunity to go into more details with you about the business and future trends at our upcoming Investor Summit in Boston on March 14. Thank you
And now Tom and I would like to take your questions
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
Yeah, I'll take that
But as you can imagine with new products, it's going to take a fair amount of time to actually fully penetrate them at installed base
But as Tom said, for both of these products, Bot Manager launched earlier in the year, Image Manager launched mid-year
Bot Manager in particular, this is the fastest-growing product we've had in a long, long time, and so the penetration is still early days
But it was a reasonably meaningful contributor to growth in Q4, in particular, our Performance and Security portfolio
You'll see that continue to ramp and further penetrate in 2018, but it's probably going to take a couple of years to see it kind of fully penetrated
As an example for Cloud Security, which we've been in market now for a little over four years
I think about 38% of our customers via Cloud Security Solutions
So still a lot of ramp to go even in Cloud Security, so it takes a while to have those customers ramp, but you can certainly see that we started a few years ago from roughly a few million dollars in Cloud Security to now over $400 million
So I think these new product offerings are kind of again proof points to Tom's comments that innovation is alive and well, and there's more to sell to the installed base to accelerate growth of the company
Yeah
We're in a good position with the DDoS solution because of our unique distributed platform
We're in a position to defend and absorb the largest attacks out there, and we've got a great track record and there's a lot of other folks that offer scrubbing services or DDoS services of one kind or another, and they've all pretty much had high profile failures
AWS, we don't see really much in the marketplace
For DDoS, it would be a different kind of approach
So we don't see that as being a significant threat to the DDoS business
And DDoS is relevant for most of our customer base, so there's a lot of cross-selling that takes place and the Security Services, in general, were leading with a sale there and a lot of new accounts where they will join with Akamai because either our DDoS solution or our application layer protection capabilities with Kona and that brings new customers to Akamai
As we talked about, they're now collectively less than 10% of our revenue so the future impact is obviously limited, and we expect to see some further decline, but nothing to scale that we've seen over the last one to two years
Not at all, not at all, that our balance sheet has a lot of firepower to do M&A, to do CapEx purchases and to do our share buyback
And as we talked about, our share buyback is intended to offset dilution, but it's a programmatic trade that buys more shares when the stock price is lower and buys fewer shares when the stock price is higher
But we have ample firepower to do full CapEx purchases, share buyback and M&A
We're certainly going to see a step-up in head count investments
You're right that we have a little bit more head count ramp here in the fourth quarter, but we hired for the year about a little over 400 people, I think, including some acquisitions
I think in years past, we averaged more than 1,000 hires per year
I think what you're going to see is that this step-up in investment is that our head count ramp is probably going to be more similar to what it's been historically than it was this past year, and as I mentioned it's going to be targeted but very heavily focused in new product innovation
There's also investment we're going to need to be making in our service delivery enablement that I mentioned, that our Services business is growing quite rapidly
And we're going to be making investments in continuing to scale the platform
So you should expect head count more similar to what it's been in the past than basically what it's been in 2016. Unknown Speaker Okay
And then just kind of a quick follow-up
Jim, you did say just in terms of looking at the Q1, we can expect a bigger sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 on a revenue basis than typically we've seen, and just wanted to understand how much of that is being driven by, like you said, the outperformance on the Media side? And how much of that is a continued expectation of â€“ and I know it's not as significant as before but just the continued declines of revenue from the top six Internet Platform Customers?
Well, yeah, I mean, as Tom mentioned that we probably will see continued decline in the Internet Platform Customers in the first quarter; one, because seasonally they declined Q4 to Q1 anyways, because they also have a seasonally stronger Q4. But I'd say the bigger component of it is not that, and it's more that we had a very strong Q4 for Media
Media traffic was kind of seasonally very, very strong
We had a large number of gaming releases, a fair number of software download events that the Media business can be a bit spiky that way
So some â€“ I'd say the bigger part of the sequential decline is driven by the Media business, certainly not the performance in Security Solutions
Unknown Speaker Got it
I think it's also fair to comment that even outside of Media that I think the company is certainly much more diversified now than it was kind of even a year ago or two years ago, that our performance in Security business now represents 60% of the company's revenue, you include kind of services, call it 70-plus percent of the revenue
So Media is becoming a much smaller percentage of the company's revenue, and we know that the Media business can have variability just given the nature of the business
So I think what you're going to see going forward is that you're going to see more stability in the company's growth rates
I do think that there is an opportunity for Media to reaccelerate growth rates, but I think the catalyst for that is really going to be a significant uptick in Over the Top viewing
And I think we're seeing steady growth in that area right now
But if you see that become more mainstream, I think we're poised to benefit significantly from that
Yeah, I'll parse that
So, certainly on the OTT side that, yeah, we're seeing very steady growth in OTT
It's been that way for some time, but it's steady growth, so it's much more consistent growth in Over The Top than say gaming or software downloads, which tend to be much more variable based on games that get released or software updates that occur
And I'd say that has been the bigger catalyst driving growth in the Media business that those â€“ the gaming and the software download area tends to be much more spiky
And you'll have surges at times and then it won't at other times
So I think the catalyst for growth in the Media business is going to be OTT
I don't think you're going to see the catalyst
You may see even a catalyst, as Tom mentioned, as you see more VR and things like that in the gaming space that require performance to work well, but I think that between things like that and OTT, that's going to be the cause of kind of re-acceleration in the Media business
And on your CapEx question, I'm glad you asked, because we certainly are not trying to signal that we're doing a build-out for some anticipation of further OTT
Actually, the build-out that we're doing is, as you can imagine, our Security business now is on an annualized run-rate of over $400 million
It's rapidly growing
And so there's build-out we're doing to support our Security business
And there's also build-out that we're doing with our secure delivery network
More customers want to have their traffic served over a secure delivery network, so we're building out capacity in that area
So it's really for other parts of the business
It's not so much for the Media business
Thanks for the question, Colby
I mean, we'll cover it more at the upcoming Investor Summit, but I still think the long-term model for the company in the low 40s is the right one
I do think that what you're going to see in 2017, and I said for the foreseeable future, because I think you're going to hear in 2017, you're going to hear about new product adjacencies that we are going to enter
And I think what you're going to see is we're going to make investments in those areas
Those investments are probably going to extend beyond 2017. And so I think the interim model for the company, not the long-term model, I think, the interim model for the company is going to be the high 30s
But I do think that once those businesses get to a level of scale, because they'll be kind of early-stage businesses, I think once they get to scale, I think that we will be able to get the company model back to the low 40s EBITDA
But I think that even beyond 2017, we intend to operate the company in the high 30s
And I think that given the nature of the adjacent areas, I think that they have significant opportunities for EBITDA that's more like our Performance and Security EBITDA
But obviously, it's going to take a time for those businesses to ramp to be able to realize that, and I think what we want to do is we don't want to constrain investment
We want to make sure we're investing to capitalize on that because now is the opportunity
Yes, yes
That means we were 14% in 2016. We'll be back in the 16% to 18% range in 2017.
Yeah
I would say that the more of the growth has been coming from selling more into our installed base
We've been able to take the offerings that we have and further penetrate them into the installed base
I think Tom's right that Security's been a product category that we've been able to penetrate with new customers, and then once you get in you can Land and Expand them
You can expand it via other offerings
But I'd say more of the growth to date has come from penetration into the installed base
And there's still a significant opportunity to do more there
I mentioned earlier that 38% of our customers buy security, so that means there's an opportunity for 62% of customers to actually buy one of our Security Solutions
And so I think you're going to see that we're going to further penetrate the offerings, and I think as we bring more innovation to the table, there's more of an opportunity to sell more into the installed base
And then I think you're going to see us do more in the way of new customer acquisition, Land and Expand model, and I think some of the new offerings are actually going to help us with that
Well, I think, again, I think you should look at our depreciation expense (54:31) as a percent of revenue to take the depreciation expense that we've been incurring as a percent of revenue
And as you ramp CapEx, as a percent of revenue you should be ramping depreciation as a percent of revenue in a similar way
We don't really operate on an overflow basis
So it's whatever you're seeing is not really attributed to that
I don't think there's really been a fundamental change in the Internet platform companies in terms of their utilization quarter-to-quarter
Generally, the trend that we expect to see is they're going to try to do more of the delivery themselves
Obviously, they'll take the easier stuff and work on that first
That's one thing that we've seen in the past
That said this stuff is hard to do and to do well and actually to do affordably
So I think that we will continue to have business with these customers
I just think it'll be a lower percentage of revenue going forward
No
I think you're going to see a steady increase in investment throughout the year
I think you're going to see that investment occur, it's going to begin in the first quarter
You won't see it manifest itself significantly because it's going to take a while to get the head count on board and the spending to ramp
So I think you're probably going to begin to see that effective in Q2. And then my expectation is that, again, it'll stay in the high 30s thereafter
So I think you'll probably â€“ I'm not going to specifically guide for Q2, but as I said beyond the first quarter, which I said 39% to 40%, and I think that it will be 39% to 40% depending upon where our revenue lands in the range
But I do expect that kind of in Q2 and beyond that it's going to operate in the high 30s
Yeah
Well, part of that is, again, when you talk about acceleration, you're talking about year-on-year
So as Tom mentioned, the declines we've seen in these large customers were much more significant in 2016. So the wraparound impact of that really began a little bit in Q4 and you're going to see that continue in Q1. And so some of it is the wraparound effect of these customers not having nearly the impact on the company growth rates as they did a year ago
My comment was more of a sequential comment that Q4 to Q1 we always see some seasonal declines in the company revenues and also with these big customers, and I expect to see that happen
And as I mentioned, I think some of the seasonal decline is going to be much more notable in the Media business, and I think you're going to see steady growth in the Performance and Security business
Yeah, roughly, yes
I wasn't referring to a specific timeframe
I think you know the company has been operating in double-digit revenue growth
This is actually the first year we have not
I think you know that certainly the driver of that has been what's been going on with these large Internet Platform Customers
The company growth rate outside of them has been growing in the mid-teens
So we have been growing in the double-digits
I think that my point was that as we make these investments, these investments are going to take a bit of time to see revenue ramp, and so you're going to see the dividends from these investments more in 2018 and 2019. And I think that is what's going to lead to consistent double-digit growth for the company
We're pretty pleased with our international growth, but you're right that our international growth has been growing very fast and growing very fast particularly in our Asia-Pacific region
So our investments are much more weighted, I would say, on R&D innovation, to be frank
Our investments are not heavily weighted towards more go-to-market
I actually think the go-to-market side of the equation â€“ we will make some investments there
It's a matter of giving our existing sales force more products to sell
Our sales force is pretty confident that penetrating our products into their installed base set of customers is a matter of giving them more products to sell, and I think that by stepping up investment in R&D, getting more products announced, I think will lead to kind of more revenue
And we've proven we can do that, Security being the most recent example
Yeah
I mean, I think in general that we continue to get good traction in upgrading Ion to our customers that buy our Web performance products that you can imagine that it's kind of a hierarchy of â€“ it starts with customers that really, really care about performance
And so I think we have a further room there, but I think that kind of the customers that are going to buy Ion â€“ many of them are already buying their products
While there's more to sell there, I'd say that probably not a significant, significant opportunity there
And, yeah, we have seen when customers upgrade to Ion that there is an ARPU uplift at times, but I also think there's other things to sell for our Web Performance Solutions
As Tom mentioned, Image Manager is another offering to sell into the installed base
So if they're buying Ion, now they can buy Image Manager
If they're DSA, now they can buy Imagine Manager
And I think you're going to see us have other adjacencies like that within Web Performance as well
And then back to the top six customers of platform customers, is there any change you guys are seeing in terms of your share of the traffic that you're delivering relative to what the platform company may be doing themselves for using a multi-CDN strategy for?
