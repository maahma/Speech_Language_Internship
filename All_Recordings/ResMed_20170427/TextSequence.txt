Thanks, Agnes
And thank you to all of our shareholders joining us today as we review financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017. We achieved solid double-digit global revenue growth again this quarter, led by sales from Software-as-a-Service businesses as well as our new mask products
For the call today, I will review top-level financial results
I will then outline regional highlights from the business and discuss a few key announcements this quarter
Finally, I will hand the call over to Brett, who will walk you through our financial results in more detail
Let me start out with some timely news
Earlier this week, we announced the much anticipated launch of the world's smallest CPAP, the ResMed AirMini
The AirMini is a CPAP solution that is literally small enough to fit inside your pocket
This innovation opens up new channels of cash payment for our homecare provider customers and delivers amazing, compact, quiet, therapeutic comfort to patients
As a CPAP user myself, I have been using a ResMed AirMini prototype in AutoSet mode for the last year or so and it has changed my quality of life as I travel throughout many of the hundred countries where we sell our products and services
I can't wait for this technology to become available to millions of sleep apnea sufferers around the world as we launch the world's smallest CPAP
I'll talk more about this amazing solution later in the call
On the connected care and digital health front, we launched a number of ongoing upgrades of our Brightree and AirView software solutions
Our Software-as-a-Service revenue continues to grow rapidly
Throughout Q3, we have had strong demand for our new range of AirFit masks, including the AirFit N20 in the nasal category and the AirFit F20 in the full face mask category
We have ramped up manufacturing for these products throughout the quarter
And despite continued strong demand, we remain on track to have supply ahead of demand during our current quarter, fiscal Q4. At the bottom line in terms of non-GAAP net operating profit, we grew at 13% on a year-on-year basis
Our diluted EPS was $0.71 on a non-GAAP basis
We continue to balance revenue growth and gross margin improvements as well as ensuring appropriate investments in research and development as well as SG&A so that we can maximize the success of multiple product launches across global markets
Now let me drill down on some regional highlights
The Americas region produced double-digit revenue growth
These results were fueled by SaaS revenue from Brightree as well as solid growth in masks
Device revenue growth this quarter was consistent with the market, and overall patient volume growth is steady
The mask and accessories category grew 8% in the quarter in the Americas
This is up sequentially from Q2, reflecting a strong demand for our new N20 and F20 products
The 97% to 99% fit range and the comfort of the InfinitySeal of the N20 and F20 are being well received
There's a long way to go on the ramp of these mask products in the quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018. Growth in devices in the Americas was in line with the market, at 3%
That was up against a large year-over-year comparable of 15%
We are maintaining the share we gained during the last 18 to 24 months due to our great devices as well as ongoing homecare provider adoption of AirView solutions and our fast-growing patient engagement app, called myAir
We now have over 3 million patients monitored with 100% cloud-connected medical devices in their homes
We also have more than 5 million patients in AirView and over 45 million patient accounts in Brightree
We are liberating data and unlocking value for physicians, providers, patients on a daily basis
We are proud to lead the digital health revolution in sleep apnea and COPD, but we are even more excited by the value that our customers see and how we are reducing costs for therapy setup and enhancing adherence rates for patients, leading to better outcomes
Brightree continues to grow strongly and in line with our acquisition model
This quarter, we launched enhanced features integrating document management capabilities between Brightree and AirView
We have a robust pipeline of software-enhancement projects that will add even more features to help make our customers' workflows more automated and efficient, freeing up cash flow for even better patient care
We also achieved very good growth of our respiratory care device platforms, led by the cloud-connected life-support ventilator called Astral
Let's spend a few minutes now reviewing our EMEA and APAC regions
Mask and accessories sales for the combined EMEA and APAC regions were up a very strong 12% this quarter, driven by the launch of our N20 and F20 products
We continued to received positive feedback in Europe and Asia from patients, physicians, home care providers regarding both the broad fit range as well as the enhanced comfort of the N20 and F20. This quarter, we also achieved solid growth in our AirSense 10 range of devices, as well as our non-invasive ventilators and Adaptive-Servo Ventilation range in Europe and Asia
Adoption of AirView by home care providers and myAir by patients is increasing in Europe as well
We achieved solid growth of our dental mandibular repositioning device called Narval
Our philosophy is however you seek treatment for your sleep apnea, ResMed should be there for you
Let me now take a few minutes to update you on progress against each of the three horizons in our 2020 Growth Strategy, and then I'll hand the call over to Brett
In the first horizon of growth, which focuses on our core sleep apnea business, we are making significant advances with the smallest, quietest and most comfortable products, enhanced by digital health and connected care solutions
We launched our new F20 and N20 in the U.S
, Europe and many other major markets around the world in the second quarter
We continue to see exceptionally strong demand for these products that led to demand continuing to outpace supply for some of the SKUs in Q3. Consistent with what we predicted 90 days ago on this call, we expect our supply to catch up with and get ahead of demand during the current quarter, fiscal Q4 2017. As I briefly discussed earlier, we announced the launch of the ResMed AirMini this week
The ResMed AirMini, once again, is the world's smallest CPAP
And, yes, it's also an APAP, with availability of our proprietary AutoSet algorithm
And, yes, it also has built-in humidification with no water that needs to be added each night
In addition, there is an AirMini app that can be used with your iOS or Android smartphone so that patients can continue to stay engaged with their therapy even when they are on the road
You can check out details in our newsroom, at newsroom
The key summary statement is we have created the world's smallest and most portable CPAP that literally fits in your coat pocket
One of the biggest requests for portable CPAP devices is the need for humidification
We have created humidification technology that's integrated into the mask tubing that we call HumidX
This amazing innovation requires no water to be added and provides patients with the humidification and comfort they have learned to expect from ResMed
Our well-established AirSense 10 device range is still the best device for at-home use
Our brand new AirMini just adds to that as the best device for use on the road
We have been conducting controlled product launches in select countries and the feedback from patients and providers on the AirMini has been excellent
We also showed the ResMed AirMini to physicians at the Sleep and Breathing Conference in Marseille, France
The doctors that saw the product there are very excited to add this to their portfolio of sleep apnea solutions for their patients
We will provide more details as we launch the ResMed AirMini over the coming quarter and throughout fiscal year 2018. We continue to lead in the field of connected care, one of the key foundations of our Growth Strategy
In February, the European research firm, Berg Insight, released their annual Mobile Health, or mHealth and Home Monitoring Report
This report named ResMed as a key global leader in remote patient monitoring, with over 2 million devices connected
We just announced that we are actually well beyond 3 million devices that are 100% cloud connected
As the world's leading tech-driven medical device company, we now have more than 1 billion nights of sleep data
Our digital health apps have been clinically proven to improve patient adherence and our software has demonstrated that it lowers the cost of therapy setup
We are developing and enhancing advanced cloud-based algorithms literally every day to convert big data into actionable information
The goal is clear; we want to lower costs of the health care system and provide better care and better outcome for patients
We are looking at partnerships with other players in digital health to enhance value across disease states, from sleep apnea and COPD to other important chronic diseases
Watch this space
On the clinical front, ResMed sponsored a research study that was presented at the Sleep and Breathing Conference that I mentioned in Marseille
This new study showed that switching patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea from CPAP to ResMed's Adaptive-Servo Ventilation, or ASV technology, significantly improves adherence
This is the largest analysis of patients with treatment-emergent central sleep apnea
The de-identified aggregated data included over 200,000 patients and leveraged our connected care and digital health platforms to run the analyses
In short, the study showed that adherence rates were increased, with a relative improvement in adherence of 22%
These patients also used their ASV therapy longer and had significantly fewer apneas during sleep compared to the control group
This study highlights the need to continuously monitor central sleep apnea and to consider therapeutic options, like ASV, based on each patient's disease severity
Moving to the second horizon of the ResMed 2020 Growth Strategy
We are in the early stages of driving our connected care strategy in COPD, and we are making good progress
We have a spectrum of cloud-connected respiratory care products across our portfolio, including cloud-connected non-invasive ventilators in the AirCurve range, cloud-connected life support ventilators, such as Astral
We also have projects on the books for cloud-connected portable oxygen concentrators
With over 200 million patients suffering from COPD and with the disease state being the number-three cause of death and the number-two cause for re-hospitalization in the Western world, we are intently focused on testing and driving models that both lower cost and improve outcomes for COPD, neuromuscular disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and beyond
Our third horizon of growth encompasses a portfolio of opportunities, including sleep health and wellness, chronic disease management as well as clinical adjacencies, including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
This quarter, the CAT-HF Study was published in the Journal of American (sic) [Journal of the American] (15:15) College of Cardiology
This is the first study to show that addressing sleep apnea with ResMed's ASV therapy may improve cardiovascular outcomes for people with preserved ejection fraction heart failure
The overall CAT-HF Study results were neutral, with a pre-specified subgroup analysis showing a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure who also have sleep apnea
Currently, there are no level of evidence 1A guideline recommended therapies specific for patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure, which accounts for half of all people living with chronic heart failure
We believe that having the CAT-HF Study published in a major cardiovascular clinical journal is the start of a journey that may prove that ASV therapy can help patients with preserved ejection fraction heart failure
Another key area of Horizon 3 growth is our work in chronic disease management algorithms, including population health models, care coordination and Software-as-a-Service models for home health, home nursing and hospice
This is an exciting area for us as we look for ongoing growth of our SaaS portfolio offerings
Let me close with this
We are incredibly excited about the ongoing launch of our new N20 and F20 mask technologies and our pipeline of products in 2017, including, of course, the new ResMed AirMini
We continue to pioneer connected care with enhanced solutions that lower costs for providers and improve outcomes for patients
We are leading the industry, driving consumer awareness of sleep apnea and COPD so that undiagnosed consumers go to see their doctors and health care providers
We continue to bring our strategy into action for the benefit of physicians, providers, payers and, most importantly, to improve the lives of tens of millions of sleep apnea and COPD patients around the world
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brett for his remarks and then we will go to Q&A
Thanks for the question, Andrew
Yes, we were on backorder in a number of the SKUs throughout Q3. As we predicted 90 days ago, we said we would be throughout Q3 and would getting supply ahead of demand in Q4. And we're reiterating that model
We still were on backorder on some of the SKUs at the end of Q3, but we are well on track with the factories ramping up their manufacturing to get supply ahead of demand in this current quarter we are in, Q4. As Brett said, that comes with a cost of some air freight
But we think getting patients this technology needs to happen and we're willing to invest in the temporary air freight to make sure that happens and we can get off the backorder this quarter and get ahead, get our supply ahead and get the supply chain catching up and look for the benefits from that throughout 2018. To your second question with regards to future products
We don't talk about products that are not yet released nor the timing of those
I'm very happy to talk about the product we released or talked about launching this week, the ResMed AirMini
But we won't talk about product pipeline, products that are not yet released
Well, I might have a first answer to that and hand over to Brett
We think it's good for business if we design a product in Sydney, Australia and manufacture it in Singapore and sell it in France, we don't think we should have extra tax on that money if we want to reinvest it in the United States
And so, we think some of the opportunities to allow companies to invest some of their cash in the U.S
is a good policy potentially
And, obviously, you've got to see that it can get through Congress and actually become law
But if there are some areas of tax relief for us to reinvest funds into, say, our Atlanta manufacturing facility or our Los Angeles, California motor design and manufacturing facilities, and beyond that, our software engineering capabilities in San Diego and Atlanta, Halifax, we would absolutely consider bringing more funds into the U.S
Brett, anything to add on that?
Thanks, Andrew
Thanks, Margaret
Yes, as you saw in the quarter, our Americas device growth was 3%
Masks was stronger at 8%-plus
And overall growth excluding Brightree was at 5%
So well in that sort of mid to high-single digits in the overall category
Look, one of the catalysts for moving those numbers up, there's many
We're doing a lot of sleep wellness and sleep awareness work with Pegasus Capital and Dr
Oz
You're going to see a number of sleep awareness promotions through our SleepScore Labs' investment with those folks
And a lot of getting out to the 40 million people who are suffering every night and snoring and not getting diagnosed as opposed to the much smaller than that, 5 million, 6 million, 7 million, 8 million who are already on therapy in the U.S
And we'll not just be doing that in this country; we'll be doing it globally on sleep awareness and sleep wellness
The other way that we're looking to drive device growth is obviously by moving our non-invasive ventilators and life support ventilators
The whole connected care revolution that happened in sleep apnea will happen in COPD, a much more severe disease state
And that will allow us to bring some high-margin device growth in life support vents and non-invasive vents
So, there's some upside in both of those areas
And the third and final area I'd say is taking this idea of this travel CPAP niche and making it a little more mainstream
I think bringing ResMed's technology to something that's the size of the water bottle in front of me
And you can have a look at the videos
We've now released the size of this product
It's about five inches by three inches by two inches
I think having the world's smallest travel CPAP with ResMed's technology and no water added for humidification and ResMed's AutoSet capability will grow that relatively small niche now to be significantly larger and allow ResMed to really drive that category
So those three things are potential catalysts for us to drive up that device number
And I've got to tell you, we plan to do it
Yes
So, look, all those things are going on in parallel and have different time frames
The sleep awareness is an ongoing one that we're planning over a long-term period
The connected care into COPD, again, is a long-term, you know we call it Horizon 2, Horizon 3 Strategy, but it's incredibly strong on benefits
Reasonably quickly we'll start to see how well the travel CPAP niche grows
And we're starting from a very low base of what's out there already, but we're really excited to play in all three of those
Sure
Brett, do you want to break out the numbers for the U.S
with and without Brightree and what Brightree's growth was? And then I'll go into some of the more strategic elements of how we're leveraging that
In that took, in essence, our Americas growth without Brightree at 5% to Americas growth with Brightree in the double digits really strong 18% top-line growth there in the Americas with Brightree
How are we looking at that strategically? I mean, obviously, we have full separation of the commercial teams on go-to-market on the sales teams on Brightree versus ResMed
But as we look at the broader market, having a SaaS capability to map workflows, reduce the costs of document management, inventory management, physician and prescription management and helping even with revenue cycle management for our customers, has really been an advantage for ResMed, an advantage for the customers, the homecare customers that have partnered with us in allowing efficiencies and freeing up cash flow so they can invest in better patient care
And then tying it to the digital side on the back end where we run AirView and myAir and are able to drive adherence rates from 50%, 60% to 80%, 90%, there's just huge upside in terms of the quality that that homecare provider provides to their customer, the doctor and their customer, insurance company in terms of keeping those patients out of hospital and happy for the doctors and the payers
And also for the patients themselves
And so it's kind of like altruism is linked to the profit motive when you're able to drive adherence up
And we're really excited to be able to do that with our connected care solutions
Thanks, Margaret
Yeah, so we're really excited about the CAT-HF analysis on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
Obviously, that study was across both HFrEF and HFpEF
But on the HFpEF side, the heart failure with preserved ejection fraction side, having a statistically significant improvement was very strong
And getting published in JACC we think is a major accomplishment
But it's the start of a longer-term journey, as you know, in this space
We have a number of follow-on clinical analyses that we are going to work on there
Professor Chris O'Connor who was working with Duke and now with Inova Heart Institute in the Washington D
, Delaware area is absolutely – and all the – not just the primary investigators, but all the investigators that are working on CAT-HF are really excited about follow-on work
We're looking at other studies in Western Europe where there's some very similar results, where ASV can have a very good impact on heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients
But these are long-term investments
They're not this quarter, next quarter
But over the next year, two, three, we think that that group, which is about half of all heart failure patients, that there's some really good upside in terms of keeping these patients out of hospital with no other pharmacological or device Class 1A guideline therapies
We think that's just an opportunity that we have to pursue, so we're going to be pursuing that over time
And we'll give updates on a periodic basis
Sure
Well, ASV, we don't break out the category specifically, but I will say, as a general trend, it has absolutely turned around from the nadir, if you like, from SERVE-HF a quarter or two or three ago to strong growth and in line with and ahead of some of the growth of the other categories, particularly in Europe
We've seen the European team really double down on ASV for treatment-emergent central sleep apnea
That study that we did on over 200,000 patients – think of that, 200,000 patients in a clinical study using the digital health and connected care
That brings two things to bear; not only the use of digital health and connected care for clinical studies that can get published, but also a much larger population base that can show ASV can be better than CPAP for treatment of those types of patients in terms of adherence
There's more to come on combining digital health and clinical studies and looking at therapies like ASV, life support vent and non-invasive vents
Thanks, Chris
Thanks for the question, Will
Actually, we think we held share
In fact, the incredible growth of share that we've achieved over the last 18 to 24 months since the launch of AirSense 10 and also Air Solutions and the AirView platform
We took very strong share with strong double-digit growth
But we think the market growth is mid to high-single digits for the whole industry
But flow generator growth is below that mid to high-singles and mask growth is at the high end of it
So we think we held the really strong share that we gained these last four to six quarters
But I'll hand it to Jim Hollingshead, who's our President of the Americas
Any further detail with regard to share and holding and growing that?
Thanks, Will
Thanks, Matt
Thanks for the question, J
P
I know I got to tell you, competitive bidding has been in play for seven years now, 28 quarters
And there was no new news in the last 90 days
So we've seen relatively stable pricing within the U.S
geography, and frankly
Also in the other 99 countries we do business in
We haven't seen any major changes to pricing
I'll hand to Jim
Any further color within the U.S
market with regard to pricing effects of CB?
Thanks, J
Thanks, Sean
I'll hand to Jim Hollingshead to walk through the market development for our POCs in the U.S
market
And maybe we can talk a little later about where we're going in Europe with that
But I think for this quarter let's focus on the U.S
Yeah, look, clearly, COPD is a huge market development opportunity for us globally
200 million patients worldwide, many of them in some of our high-growth markets
As we start to grow particularly our China and India business, COPD will be a major play for that
I think in those fast-growing markets to avoid some of the sick care system where COPD patients get really sick and then appear at the hospital on a regular basis within many Western European countries that we're working on keeping them out of hospital with our cloud-connected devices
We can reestablish models of out-of-hospital care for those patients
So in developing markets or fast-growing markets, like China and India, about setting up systems that avoid the current sick care hospital care system in some of the Western world
But then within the Western world, it's about looking at things differently, trying to find ways to use connected care to predict when patients may have exacerbations and have through chronic disease management physician or nurse practitioner contact with a patient to prevent a hospitalization
We think that's a huge opportunity in the long term and something that we're absolutely focused on
And in the short to medium term, we have home health, hospice and home nursing capabilities within Brightree and beyond in the ecosystem which we think can be leveraged to help keep those patients out of the hospital, too
So almost three phases of COPD growth
One in the fast-growing areas of China, India, Eastern Europe developing new models
Two, doubling down on our chronic disease management and connected care play for COPD
And three, some longer-term models to leverage our out-of-hospital Software-as-a-Service capabilities
Thanks, Sean
Thanks for the question, David
I'll start with this and I'll maybe hand off to Jim because the primary first marketed launch will be in the United States, where there's strong demand for this
ResMed's been in business for 28 years next month
And I've worked at the company for 17 years
And almost every time I've talked to a patient, they've asked me, when is ResMed coming up with a travel CPAP solution? I've seen the stuff out there, but it's not what I want
I want ResMed quality
And we spent a long time making sure we could miniaturize this right and that we could get humidification technology miniaturized and able to be used on the go and we could link it to the world's best masks and housings (56:32)
And we got there
And I've been personally using this ResMed AirMini for 12 months and it's totally changed my travel life, whether I'm on a plane, in a hotel
Wherever I am, I get AutoSet, I get humidification and I get my Nasal Pillows, my P10 with me
And so right at the moment, to your question around sizing, it's a small niche
It's sub-1% of the device market niche
We think we can grow it very significant multiples of where it is now
And we think ResMed can have a very strong share in that with the smallest, quietest, most comfortable, best connected, best humidified product in the category
Having said all that, we're in controlled product launch
I'm obviously very excited about the opportunity as a patient and a user
But I'm also excited as a business manager for where this could go
Jim, any further thoughts about AirMini and how it can grow the category?
It's really difficult to predict exactly what that 9% number could have been if we had had no backorder
I know it would have been above 9%
So it's 10%-plus
Hard to predict exactly what it was because we weren't able to ship those products
I do think it's a huge opportunity for us as we go into Q4 to get supply ahead of demand
You never want to be behind
But of all of the problems to have, it's probably one of the better ones
But we don't even want to have that problem, so we're going to eliminate that here in Q4. And then as we go throughout 2018, we'll be completely supply unconstrained and be able to meet every piece of demand for the N20 and F20. And as I said earlier, we're really excited about the technology InfinitySeal and broad fit range and its capability to get to patients there
I think we are now at the 60-minute mark, so I'll probably hand back to Agnes
Oh, okay
I'll just close up
All right
So, in closing, I want to thank the more than 5,000 strong ResMed team as they've been diligently driving execution of the N20 and F20 launches and the exciting launch of the ResMed AirMini, as well as our future pipeline of innovative products
Our team continues to demonstrate unwavering commitment to changing the lives of millions of patients
We remain focused on our long-term goal of improving 20 million lives by 2020. I want to thank the global ResMed team
And we're really excited about the future innovations and strategies for what we can do with connected care and digital health for 2025 and beyond
Thank you and we'll talk to you in 90 days
I'm going to hand over to Agnes
