Thanks, Frank
Like other members of our leadership team, I spend much of my time with our strategic clients
And I listen for new ways to add value to their businesses, including how to help speed their transformation journey
Our clients of course pay close attention to the rising expectations of their customers and the competitive moves of their peers, so they know how fast things are changing and how easy it is to be left behind if their business, operating, and technology models are not digital through and through
We're responding by investing in the build-out of repeatable industry-specific solutions that we can deploy across our practices
These platforms solve pressing problems and deliver measurable results
Frank talked about clients needing to digitize their entire enterprises, so let's look at a few examples of how they're deploying digital at scale
Many consumer product companies today are running to catch up to their retailers' new expectations for engaging customers
Retailers expect relevant product suggestions and self-service channels as well as speed and convenience when placing orders with their suppliers
In response, Cognizant has developed a next-gen sales platform that enables businesses to acquire and retain more customers and sell more product
Next-gen sales is built on our Onvida SaaS platform, which is a cloud-based and omni-channel
You may recall that Onvida also serves as the foundation for the physician and patient communication network of LifeBridge Health, a client I talked about last quarter
To create next-gen sales, we have integrated digital commerce, email marketing, account acquisition, and advanced analytics in one platform
Consider the impact of this platform on a large consumer products client
This organization needed to replace its traditional phone-based sales operation with a digital ordering and service platform, a true digital commerce and marketing portal
They also wanted to become more effective at cross-selling and upselling products by applying advanced analytics
In just a few quarters, we ramped from inception to production
We are now in the process of onboarding their thousands of B2B customers as we move more than 25% of their phone transactions to digital channels
Among the benefits they will see are: a significant uplift in revenue; a double-digit reduction in operating costs; and a far more compelling customer experience
Many companies face similar challenges and need cloud-based digital commerce solutions, so we see plenty of market opportunity for our next-gen sales platform
Another area where operating models need to be modernized and automated is workflows
To bring intelligence to these workflows, we've developed and are deploying our proprietary digital automation fabric
This fabric combines image recognition, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and process automation
Here are two examples of clients applying our advanced framework
For a leading mortgage information service provider, we've worked to redesign the workflows of their loan origination, servicing, and support functions
The result, our implementation reduces staff by a third and can pass (14:55) more than 200 million pages a year with data accuracy that exceeds 99%
And for a global property and casualty insurer, our deployment has substantially reduced unnecessary claims and saved tens of millions of dollars
We continue to expand this framework to other industry solutions
Now I want to turn to the financial performance of our business segments and geographies
Let's start with banking and financial services
Second quarter revenues were up 4.1% year over year, driven mostly by our growth in insurance
In insurance, we're seeing broad-based growth across clients and strong demand for multi-service line managed service deals
The overall performance of our banking clients has improved from the first quarter, but we still see large money center banks taking a conservative approach to their spending and continuing to focus on optimizing their cost structures
This is being partly offset by continued strong growth in our mid-tier accounts
In healthcare, our second quarter revenues were up 9.5% year over year, driven by both our life science and payer clients
Broadly, we've seen a healthy pickup in demand across our payer clients
This includes pent-up demand from those healthcare payers involved in M&A activity last year
The healthcare industry continues to shift from fee-for-service to value-based care models
In response, healthcare organizations seek new ways to deliver consumer-centric care while driving operational efficiency and lowering medical costs
These competitive pressures persist despite continued uncertainty about the ACA's future
We've invested heavily in our healthcare practice, creating a differentiated offering that has positioned us well to meet evolving client demand
And we're actively helping many of our clients manage through this transition
Let's turn to our other business segments, Products and Resources and Communications, Media and Technology
Today they make up over a third of our total company's revenue and are meaningful contributors to our growth and our portfolio diversification
Products and Resources grew 13.2% year over year as a result of continued strong performance with our manufacturing and logistics clients
As these clients sensor-enable their products, they're embracing enterprise digital transformation
To harness the power of their connected products, we must rearchitect and transform their supporting business processes as well as simplify and modernize their technology models
That's how they'll create new digital products and drive new revenue streams
Our Communications, Media and Technology segment had another strong quarter of broad-based growth, up 16.8% year over year
Our clients in CMT are focused on creating a differentiated experience that delivers personalized content to their customers
Doing so requires each client to efficiently and effectively manage content, from acquisition through targeted distribution and analytics
We're responding with a repeatable digital content operations solution
It uses human intervention, machine learning, and digital platforms to ensure the right content is viewed by the right person at the right time and place
Now let's look at our performance in emerging geographies
Europe was up 5.7% year over year after a 6.1% negative currency impact
This was driven by strength on the continent in key markets such as France and the Netherlands and by strategic investments made in the second half of 2016. By the way, earlier this month we opened our new London Digital Business Collaboratory
This co-lab combines human-centric design with digital technologies to enable clients to deliver engaging new experiences for their customers
To close out our geographic discussion, we had continued strong growth in the rest of the world, which was up 21.2% year over year
This growth was driven by key Asia-Pacific markets such as India and Australia
And just as we have done in continental Europe, we're building a strong local presence and investing both organically and inorganically in these emerging markets
In recent calls, we've talked about Cognizant's evolving workforce and delivery
I'd like to add a few points to this discussion
The engines of our digital practice areas are our talented and deeply skilled professionals
To ensure they stay on digital's cutting edge, we're investing tens of millions of dollars this year to continuously deepen and broaden their skills in areas such as analytics, artificial intelligence, data science, and digital security
Cognizant is also building skills and capabilities in local communities where we operate around the world
One way is by partnering with educational institutions to establish and fund retraining programs in high-demand digital technologies
For example, we partner with Per Scholas, a national organization to create a job training program in the south Bronx
It's designed to help New Yorkers access career opportunities in tech, and we plan to hire at least 350 of the program's initial graduates for our client sites in New York's five boroughs
We've also been developing similar training programs in Des Moines, Tampa, Phoenix, and Charlotte as well as internationally
For example, in Singapore we're partnering with educational institutions to provide the local community with STEM-related training
And in Switzerland, we run an apprentice program that trains students in application development and testing
In short, our company runs on talent, and we remain committed to attracting, developing, and retaining the best talent in the world
To wrap up, we're driving digital scale by building repeatable industry-specific solutions that enable clients to add significantly more value to their businesses
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen to cover our financial performance
Hey, Brian, this is Raj
Look, I think when you look at healthcare, we've invested very heavily on our healthcare practice, and it's really created a differentiated offering which has positioned us well
And if you look at the entire practice, with what's happening with the healthcare ecosystems, with the providers, the payers, and the pharma, with all the collaboration that's going on there, and these are all big practices for us, so I think that we're positioned very well in healthcare
And in addition to that, we've talked about last year we had a couple large M&A transactions, and obviously with those going away, you see a lot of the pent-up demand
So there's still some uncertainty with what happens with the ACA
But overall, I think this year and going into next year with the position we are, we're well positioned
Regarding some of the BPO, we haven't seen any impact on that at all
Hi, Jim
So look, I think the overall financial services, I think if we look at the entire practice, obviously insurance continued doing well
Where the challenge is, is a little bit on the banking side
And as we talked about, regional banks are healthy, strong growth
Where we're challenged is on a couple of the large money-center banks
The good news here is obviously we're in a better position than I think we were at this time last year with them
But as we look out, they're still very much focused on the cost side and optimizing that, but we are, obviously, engaged with many of them on digital-type engagements
Now as these projects become larger scale enterprise initiatives, I think we're well positioned to benefit from that
But right now, that's our focus area right now in terms of continuing to invest and continuing to be well positioned for those large enterprise transformations
Moshe, the large money central banks obviously have both a European and U.S
presence
So I think you're seeing softness there because of the discretionary work not kicking in as fast as we would like it
Now again, like I said, we're engaged in a lot of the digital initial work with those banks
And as these banks continue to get healthier, I would expect that you would start seeing some more of the enterprise transformation initiatives that we're expecting
And I think we're well positioned
If you look at it from the business to the operations to the technology layers, I think there are very few companies that can help these banks
And so that's obviously areas that we're investing in, and we're hopeful for future growth as they get healthier
I have nothing to add to that, Joe
We could say that as we continue the process of building out regional centers in the U.S
as opposed to our historical model where folks have been more onsite in our client locations, I think that that will help drive utilization actually higher, because when we have people in a physical location, our ability to redeploy them across clients and so on and so forth, the project then becomes higher
Now that's a longer-term trend
Our journey of building out regional centers is well underway, but we have some ways to go on that
So I think as regional centers become a greater portion of our overall onsite workforce, I think that will be a contributor to being able to take onsite utilization up higher
And I think, operator, we have time for one more question
