Thanks, Wes
While I would like to make a few comments regarding 2016, most of my thoughts will be focused on our plans for 2017 and beyond
From a strength perspective, we made great progress last year on the management of our inventory levels and expenses across the company
We also showed great improvement during the course of the year on merchandise margin
Our opportunity, of course, continues to be on the top line, and that has been driven by disappointing traffic metrics
I still believe that the strategic framework of the Greatness Agenda is the path to changing that top line trend over time, and our associates feel the same way
In our focus on product initiatives, we've successfully grown the depth and breadth of our national brand portfolio, and we saw national brand penetration increase to 54% of sales last year
National brands were up low-single digits for the year, with particular strength in NIKE, CarterÂ´s, Levi's, Columbia and Van Heusen, and the launch of Apple Watches in the fourth quarter
As we move into 2017, we expect the launch of Under Armour will drive the penetration even higher, and project it to be a significant enough business in year one to add 75 basis points to 100 basis points to our overall company comp
We're also starting to see better results in our private brands as our speed initiatives take hold
Our key private brands which were involved in our speed initiative last year achieved a low single-digit positive comp in total for the fourth quarter
As the speed initiative expands this spring to other private and exclusive brands across apparel and soft home, the percentage of our proprietary brand business impacted by the speed initiative will move from 25% at the end of last year to about 40% of our overall proprietary sales this year
In addition, the relaunch of our Jumping Beans children's brand should turn that business from a drag on our sales to a major positive
And finally, our localization efforts now impact about 85% of our assortment and are having a positive impact on sales, as well as reducing inventory levels at the same time
In our focus on omnichannel initiatives, we are beginning to see the results of our multi-year multi-billion-dollar investment in digital technology as online demand and fulfillment metrics are improving
Online demand was up in the low-teens for both fourth quarter and for the year
We also improved our shipping and fulfillment expenses as a percentage of digital sales, while increasing the speed to customer by half a day overall
Just as importantly, approximately one-third of our digital sales units were either shipped from store or picked up in our stores in the fourth quarter
Our ship-from-store capability enhancements, along with buy online, pick-up in store enhancements, have improved the customer experience and leveraged the power of our store portfolio
We'll be aggressively marketing the BOPUS functionality option and ease this year, and expect the penetration to climb significantly in 2017. Mobile continues to drive digital engagement metrics, and 30% of our digital sales came from mobile devices for the year
Mobile devices account for over 50% of our digital traffic
The investments and experiences involved in our Kohl's Wallet, our Kohl's app, and Kohl's Pay are driving our 19 million Wallet users' engagement
The same is true of our mobile-centric Yes2You Rewards loyalty program
Moving on to our focus on inventory and expense management
Inventory levels and receipt flows were areas we made major progress on last year, and we saw the benefits of that growing in importance throughout the year
By year-end, overall inventory was down about 5% in dollars and 7% in units
More importantly, our fall seasonal inventory was down about 25%, and our spring forward transitional inventory was up about 9% within that total
This impacted several key metrics very positively, including merchandise margin for the fourth quarter, in-store and logistics expenses related to material handling, and a dramatic improvement, as Wes mentioned, in cash flow for the year
Our intent is to continue to lower inventory per store about 3% per year for the next three years at cost, with larger reductions at retail and in units
An improved supply chain focused on speed, localization initiatives, and leveraging technology to increase the percentage of inventory shipped from stores to fulfill online demand or online demand picked up in store will all play a factor in this
This is one of the most important initiatives in the company
We're also pleased with our ability to manage our expenses lower when we did not achieve our expected sales results last year
With the pressure of higher hourly wages in our stores and distribution network, spending less overall on SG&A was a very meaningful accomplishment
Having said that, we need to do better
As a result, we've launched a profit improvement project, take significant expense out of our company
I expect to share more about that effort as we go through this year, and expect some impact coming later this year with the majority coming in 2018 and 2019. Drivers of that effort will be to improve speed and agility across the company, in the same way we've accomplished it in our product and inventory initiatives
As I just indicated, on the product side, this has resulted in lower inventory levels and better profitability
And I believe the same approach in our expense structure will have a similar and permanent impact
I would expect all areas of our expense lines to participate in the profit improvement project
Moving on to our focus on store optimization
As you know, we made a decision to close 18 stores last year, with most closing in June
Now that the fourth quarter is behind us, we've been able to measure the impact of those closures in a number of ways, at a customer level, at a store and market level, and on the impact in online sales
We believe that overall, we've retained about a third of the sales from the closed stores in other nearby stores, and about 90% of the online sales in those areas
This is less than we estimated
We want to continue to monitor the results throughout the spring season
Those results will help inform future decision-making on store optimization
Our overall perspective though and the importance of our store portfolio remains the same
We believe stores are very important and critical component of our future success, and we're committed to leverage them to their full extent
There's great power in stores in an omnichannel world
We also know, however, that the average sales per store have fallen as online sales have risen
And so an ongoing rigorous process for store performance review is critical to long-term success
We continue to review performance by store
It's against the menu of options considered to improve that performance when less than desired
Certainly, our first focus continues to be to drive traffic in a positive direction in all stores, and included among actions after that are the following
First, remerchandising and refixturing full-sized but lower volume stores to improve both profitability and customer experience
This effort is called standard to small, and is being expanded this year by 200 stores
It has shown, to-date, no result in an impact on sales, but an increase in gross margin due to right-sized inventories, and lower four-wall SG&A due to lower inventory and more efficient use of space
A second option is rightsizing or relocating existing stores into smaller footprints
This allows us to maintain our presence and trade area, and improve productivity and profitability in much the same way
Our 55,000 square-foot and our new 35,000 square-foot prototypes now allow us to execute this profitably given that we've built the operating model through the testing of these stores
The final option, of course, is removing from our store portfolio, those stores that don't make a positive financial contribution and look to have no promise to do so
This is only done when the first two options don't provide a better solution
This was the case with the stores we closed last year
And future decisions will now be informed more directly from that experience
The result of all of these efforts is that we'll achieve a rationalization of square footage over time, not necessarily fewer stores, but probably less square footage
In summary, before I turn it back to Wes to provide 2017 guidance, I want to reinforce that while we're committed to investing in the long-term health of our business, we also intend to continue to be good stewards of capital
As you saw in our press release, our board has approved a 10% increase in our dividend for 2017. In addition, we'll continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchase program, would expect to purchase less than we did in 2016, targeting $300 million to $400 million in repurchases
We do feel that the uncertainty in our sector will continue, and we want to maintain a strong balance sheet that would allow us to execute quickly as opportunities arise to garner share
So, with that, I'll turn it back to Wes to provide some information on guidance
There isn't anything specific in mind, Lorraine
I think it's informed by two things
One, it's just an acknowledgment that we've been unable, to-date, to drive the top line positive, and so being more thoughtful about the balance sheet simply makes sense to us
But yes, secondarily, I think that we do want to stay in a particularly strong capital and balance sheet standpoint in order to take advantage of things like new brands that might come where we could invest in them, much in the same way as we did with Under Armour, and drive increased top line in the future
So things like new brands certainly come to mind, perhaps store opportunities where we have relocation or rightsizing availability
So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular, but it's sort of acknowledging the environment that we're in and, at the same time, recognizing that we're in phenomenally good capital shape, and so we want to be poised if something appears to us to be an opportunity
Thanks, Oliver
And I'll answer on the product side, and Wes can mention some of the specifics around the investments on capital and omnichannel
I mean accessories has been a drag on the business, both in the fourth quarter, where it underperformed actually the most of all of our six business categories, and also for the year, where it was similar in terms of underperformance, and I think it's all product related
And so you've heard Michelle talk about the need to improve product decisions, about the need to improve speed in our sourcing in order to flow receipts more quickly when we see product cycles develop, to lower inventory so that we have more flexibility
And it's clearly a big focus
Our women's business overall has more modestly underperformed, not to the extent that accessories did, but they're connected, as you well know
So I think it's a lot about product, and I think she feels like the inventory management initiatives, the product initiatives that we're focused on will improve it over time
And it includes, of course, the underperformance in our fine jewelry business as well
On the initiatives and the omnichannel investment, I'll let Wes tell you
There's no vision in terms of the square footage in the future
I think the thing that we're pretty aligned on is that with more business being initially driven online, while we will continue to work hard to improve the percentage of that, that we can fulfill from our stores, whether shipped from store or buy online, pick up in store
The overall impact is that the brick-and-mortar stores will continue to probably do a little bit less
We're trying to modestly improve that, of course, from where it's been because we were down, as Wes said, traffic in the 5% to 6% range last year
But it's really all focused on the strategies we just talked about
We do think that having a big footprint is really important
We sort of suspected that as we closed the stores that we closed last June, that it could have an impact on omnichannel sales in those trade areas, and it did
So that just sort of reinforces the need to have a great footprint, but they'll be smaller
I mean that's really what it's going to be about
And as you know, we tested the 55,000 square-foot stores for quite a long time, but last year, we tested the 35,000 square-foot stores, and I think that now gives us a lot of confidence that we know how to operate those stores profitably
In terms of resource allocation, I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at
I mean, overall, Oliver, I think we're leaving you with, hopefully, the impression we think footprint in terms of number of stores is important, and we don't necessarily see that going down
It actually, possibly could even go up
Second, they're going to be smaller stores for sure
And the way they're going to be smaller is to use technology to enable process inside the store more efficiently and fulfillment inside the store more efficiently, and use our speed initiative and our sourcing strategies and our localization initiatives to be able to make better decisions on which brands and which categories are emphasized more in a smaller footprint
Hopefully that gets your answer done
If you look at last year, we were down a little over 2%
We're essentially implying that we'd be down in the middle of our range around 1%, so that says we got to improve 100 basis points, 150 basis points
I don't think there's any particular quarter that we're focused on
Certainly, there was weakness in the first quarter last year, but at the same time, as you know, we've really, dramatically reduced inventories this year
So our clearance levels and fall transitional inventories are way down compared to last year, so that always has an impact early in the quarter
I think we're looking at the Under Armour launch as an ongoing investment, so it's definitely not quarter focused
I mean, we see that lifting sales over time
So I really, honestly, we haven't targeted one quarter to be a little better than another
If you look at the performance last year, we had weak traffic all year really
And so, for us to get from, let's say, down 2% plus last year to down, let's say, 1% or even flat, we need to improve store traffic from down 5% or 6% to be down more like 3%
That's really what the math works out to be because our expectation is that omnichannel sales will continue to grow somewhere in the low double-digit range
No
I mean, we try to avoid talking about periods when we're in the middle of them
And I think pretty much what we gave you, Mark, in terms of how we look at the periods is about the extent of what we can say
The actual pontoon launch, I can't comment on
I'm sure it's coming sometime this spring
No, the process is ongoing, Bob, and there's nothing really to update you on
I feel pretty good about it, and Wes and I all along have been aligned that he would stay with us through this transition and then move off once we land on somebody
But I would still expect it to be sort of early in this spring season sometime
Sure
I mean, using last year as a baseline, Active and Wellness grew basically double-digits last year
And it's on the trajectory, from a planning perspective, in 2017 to continue at that kind of rate of growth
Under Armour, we look at as being fundamentally, really incremental
I mean it's such a desired brand
If you've seen the stores, Bob, I think you'll see that we've expanded the space in the Active areas by 25% to 30%, depending upon the store
We think there's such massive opportunity with Under Armour in categories like women's apparel, our children's apparel and footwear that they really could impact the overall business
So we're not really looking at other Active brands being diminished by the introduction of Under Armour
We're really kind of looking at Under Armour as an incremental opportunity
And that's why I think we sort of guided to Under Armour could have an impact as much as 100 basis points in the overall company comp for the year
I think if you're referring to Lauren Conrad and her dress-up shops, I'm sure she's rolling over right now, Bob
No, in all seriousness, Lauren Conrad is probably one of the shining stars of our proprietary brands
We have talked about the fact that while our private brands, SONOMA, Apt
9, Croft & Barrow, are really starting to see some traction as we got further and further into last year, and we see a lot of opportunity going in 2017, the drag on our brand performance and our product performance has really been on exclusive brands
And the two big exceptions there are Vera Wang, which has continued to perform well, but notably, Lauren Conrad that has performed well consistently through all of this
So, in all seriousness, Michelle would tell you, that is a business we're looking to grow a lot
I mean, in all honesty, Matt, the inventory initiatives, I mentioned it in our prepared remarks, is probably the most important initiative we have after driving top line positive
And we just see this as an ongoing process
And if you think about all of the technology initiatives that we have, they're all focused on improving utilization of inventory in our stores because that's our biggest asset
So whether it's ship-from-store or buy online, pick up in store, all that technology is trying to use the inventory we already have to drive sales more effectively and efficiently, and then you know that the biggest initiative we have on product really has to do with speed
And we know that, that will have not just short-term, but long-term impacts on our turnover
And so we just think we're really early here, last year was sort of the beginning, but this is a permanent long-term strategy for us to improve speed to market on our sourcing and technology to enable better utilization of our inventory across the whole portfolio
And we're seeing the benefit from localization in a big way because we're able to place inventory in our stores in the right way
Well, we're not â I mean I wouldn't want to get into the specifics around focuses on brands, but we've made it clear which areas of our business we think there's opportunity in
We do believe that given our commitment to our footprint, our physical footprint across the country, that we become a more appealing choice for brands
And I think as others shrink, that only enhances the opportunity we have to take advantage of that
So it's definitely a focus, there's no question about it, but I wouldn't want to get into the specifics, Matt
Well, I think â I mean to point â to be totally honest with you, Bernie, to point to marketing as either our issue or our opportunity would be not very thoughtful
I mean we have multiple things going on at the same time, which is generally a sort of weak apparel environment overall
We have lots of challenges that we've talked about at length in our product assortments, some in certain categories like accessories, some in certain parts of our branding like exclusive brands, so these things kind of all impact traffic and all impact sales
You're right that we've consistently said that we think loyalty as an instrument and personalization as a vehicle are our long-term strategies to drive more efficiency in marketing, and I can't point to the fourth quarter of last year as a massive improvement there because we spent more on marketing and we actually did fewer sales
So you're 100% right on that
But we do see in the underlying metrics that personalization is the path we should be on, and that loyalty is the key avenue for us to use personalization in
I don't think there's any question about that
Nothing is changing about that at all
I don't know, Wes, if you want to add anything
Well, I think there's no question, Bernie â I think you had a question in there somewhere, but I think what you're asking is what are we doing to make our value more clear to customers
And so without taking a lot of time on the call â and I'm sure Wes would be happy to take you through this separately in more detail â simplification of our value is a key priority in marketing, and we see doing that by tailoring our messages through our loyalty platforms, which are fundamentally Kohl's Cash, Yes2You Rewards and the Kohl's Charge, on a personal basis to consumers so it's more understandable
And then on a very personal basis, providing offers to them that are unique to them in real time so that they activate and engage more often, because that's fundamentally our problem, is that people aren't responding to the more traditional media that we have at the same rate they used to
So, I mean summarizing it, that's kind of the plan and the strategy
And the results we're seeing gives us some confidence as we scale this up that there's real value there, but we have to show it
I would definitely acknowledge that the only way you show that is to improve the traffic levels in the store from last year's level to a better level this year, and then I can tell you it's working
Thanks, Bernie
Sure
Well, the speed initiative really began to roll out early last year
Wes will correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, but I think we focused, first and foremost, logically on areas where speed's a more important factor, which was a category, for instance, in women's like juniors, where brands like SO, our young private brand for juniors, we could have a meaningful impact by delivering more often and more quickly
And that â those results, which were phenomenal, but, of course, in a relatively small part of the overall store, then began to roll out into other parts of our business
Women's apparel is definitely a focus in this effort
And so speed's starting to take hold in other key proprietary brands in women's apparel like SONOMA and like Apt
9, and now like Croft & Barrow, were the next avenue
And then finally, of course, we also know speed impacts â speed impacts everything, so it also has begun to roll out into home as well
So I think we gave you some statistics which are very generalized, but basically kind of said, hey, of our proprietary brand portfolio, at the end of the year, about 25% of our proprietary brands were being impacted by the speed initiative
And as we go into 2017, we see that moving up to 40%-plus in terms of its impact
I mean, the other thing I'd say, Tracy, on speed to reinforce something we talked about in the call, but the experience we've had on the speed initiative in product, we believe that is actually the blueprint for working with more speed and working with more agility as a result across the whole company
And so we're going to use that blueprint in trying to reimagine everything from our organizational structures in various areas, including our stores, to the way we approach our business overall
And we think what that will do is allow us to also begin to bring down expenses more effectively and more permanently
So speed and agility, overall, is probably the number one strategy we have at Kohl's
And I think, Wes, in the fourth quarter, we finally got some improvement in packages per order
Which is â that's a signal, I think, for us that the investments we've made in the technology side to help do the logic in terms of how orders get fulfilled are starting to pay off
And that's why we pointed to that, because I think the fourth quarter was actually the first time that we saw an improvement there moving in the right direction
I think pretty close to
Sure
On Under Armour's impact overall, I actually â I think the way we're looking at that is that it should drive positive momentum both on traffic, because frankly, they do have a younger customer
And I think it's a customer who's been going elsewhere to get that brand and now can come to Kohl's
But it will positively impact UPT because overall, national brand transaction value in average in retails are, in fact, higher
So, as I said at the beginning, it's not all necessarily a one-for-one positive impact on sales, but for the most part, we're looking at Under Armour as an incremental business
It's not cannibalizing some other business
So we think it will be a plus overall, and it'll be definitely a plus in the Active space for sure
Moving on from Under Armour, I think we've just got to just keep it more generalized, Tiffany, that national brands, we think, are really important to our future
And so we're going to continue to focus on being the place with a physical footprint large enough to give distribution avenues and opportunities to brands that they either don't have today or they have but they're shrinking
And so we just think that, that's a place for us to win big
Thanks
I mean, we give you these numbers, they're very generalized numbers because by default, they're averages
And so the percentage of sales that we retain from a closed store in a particular trade area can range greatly
They could be as low as 20%, depending upon the market, to as high as 50%, depending upon the market
So, Wes is right, it's on an average, we estimated 38% retention and we got 34%
We didn't know what would happen on omnichannel sales, but we suspected we might lose a little momentum and we did
And those two facts really help inform how we look going forward at stores
Thanks very much
