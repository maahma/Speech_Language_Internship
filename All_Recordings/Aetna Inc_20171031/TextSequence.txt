Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone
Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $814 million and adjusted earnings per share of $2.45, year-over-year growth of 11% and 18% respectively
Our third quarter results reflect strong core business fundamentals driven by disciplined pricing, moderate medical cost trend and continued capital deployment
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance
Our medical membership of 22.2 million is in line with our expectations for the period
Adjusted revenue was $14.9 billion, a year-over-year decrease driven by a planned reduction in Commercial ACA insured membership, the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee and known Medicaid contract losses
These dynamics were partially offset by higher premium yields in our Commercial and Government businesses and membership growth in our Medicare products
From an operating perspective, our businesses are performing well
Our adjusted pre-tax margin was 9.2%, a very strong result and at the high end of our target range
Our third quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 81.9%, an improvement of 10 basis points compared to the same period last year
Our third quarter results reflect strong underwriting performance that more than offset the approximately 200 basis point impact of the one-year suspension of the health insurer fee
Our adjusted expense ratio was 17.5%, a 10 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2016, driven primarily by the suspension of the health insurer fee in 2017 and the continued execution of our expense management initiatives, partially offset by the targeted investment spending on growth initiatives discussed on prior earnings calls this year
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves
We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter 2017 dates of service and our days claims payable were stable sequentially at 54 days at the end of the quarter
Turning to cash flow and capital, our year-to-date Health Care and Group Insurance cash flows were approximately 1.5 times net earnings
During the quarter, we distributed $166 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend and we repurchased $545 million of our shares
Year to date we have returned a total of approximately $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases in our quarterly shareholder dividend
In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our strategy to become a more consumer-focused company
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter results in greater detail
Beginning with our Government business, we delivered another solid quarter, continuing our positive momentum from the first half of 2017. From a membership perspective, we grew by 23,000 Medicare members in the quarter, including growth of 11,000 in individual Medicare Advantage
Our Medicaid membership declined by approximately 218,000 members in the quarter, primarily driven by our June 30 exit of the Maryland ASC contract
This membership decline was in line with our previous projection for the period
We grew our third quarter 2017 Government premiums, which represent over half of our total health care premiums, to $6.7 billion
Medicare premiums grew nearly 5% compared to the prior-year period, driven by strong premium growth of 12% in individual Medicare Advantage
Medicaid premiums declined year over year due to previously disclosed state contract exits
Our Government medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a continuation of the strong results we achieved in this business during the first half of the year
Shifting to our Commercial business, which also had a very strong third quarter from an operating margin perspective, we grew insured Commercial membership in the quarter by 177,000 members, reflecting international growth related to our acquisition of Bupa Group's Thailand business, partially offset by our continued repositioning in small group ACA-related products, which drove reduced small group insured membership
From a year-over-year perspective, total Commercial premiums were lower, largely the result of our reduced ACA-compliant individual and small group exposure and the suspension of the health insurer fee, partially offset by higher premium yields
However, our large group Commercial premiums were modestly higher as compared to the third quarter of 2016 despite the impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee
Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.4% for the quarter, a very good result and a 240 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2016 despite the negative influence of the suspension of the health insurer fee
To better understand the year-over-year comparison let me discuss the drivers of our underwriting results by product group
Continuing the momentum from the first half of the year, we delivered another strong quarter of underwriting results in our large group Commercial insured products
Our third quarter results reflect continued pricing discipline and moderate medical cost trends
Based on our year-to-date 2017 results, we now expect our 2017 non-ACA core Commercial medical cost trends will be approximately 5.5%
We also had a strong quarter of underwriting results in our small group Commercial product as we continue to have success in repositioning these products to improve their profitability
Moving to our ACA-compliant individual Commercial product, our third quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, with lower losses compared to the same period last year due in large part to our reduced membership
Based on our third quarter results and excluding prior-year items, we continue to project an underlying loss on 2017 ACA-compliant individual Commercial products
Shifting to our fee-based group Commercial business, we grew Commercial ASC membership by 95,000 members in the third quarter
We now serve nearly 410,000 more Commercial ASC members compared to the same period last year
From a profitability perspective, our group Commercial fee-based business had another solid quarter, exceeding our previous expectations
Moving on to the balance sheet, our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong
At September 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 39.5%, reflecting our decision in the quarter to pre-fund $1 billion of debt maturities that come due in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect our year-end 2017 debt-to-total-capitalization ratio to come back down to be more in line with our targeted range
Looking at cash and investments at the parent, we started the quarter with approximately $203 million
Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $705 million
We issued $1 billion in debt in the quarter
We paid a shareholder dividend of $166 million
We used $545 million to repurchase shares
And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash at the parent, reflecting the previously discussed pre-funding of fourth quarter 2017 debt maturities
Our basic share count was approximately 326.1 million at September 30. This morning, we increased our 2017 adjusted earnings per share guidance to approximately $9.75 based on continued strong performance in the third quarter
Our updated 2017 projections are influenced by the following drivers
We now project our full year 2017 adjusted revenue to be approximately $60.5 billion, reflecting the divestiture of our U.S
group life and disability businesses
We now project that our full year total Health Care medical benefit ratio will be approximately 82.3%
This improved outlook is driven by continued moderate medical costs
We now project our adjusted pre-tax margin to be approximately 8.9%, consistent with our high single-digit target
We now project adjusted earnings will be nearly $3.3 billion
And we now project full year 2017 dividends from subsidiaries to be up to $3.2 billion excluding any dividends related to the cash consideration received for the sale of our U.S
group life and disability businesses
Excluding dividends related to the sale, we expect to end the year with approximately $400 million in parent cash, reflecting the repayment of $1 billion of debt maturities during the fourth quarter and additional capital deployment
The balance of our 2017 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary
As is our convention, we will not be providing any 2018 projections on today's call
However, I will provide some directional commentary to help investors better understand some of the larger moving items that we expect will impact 2018 adjusted revenue and adjusted earnings
As you know, as a matter of course we do not include prior-year's reserve development in our forward earnings projections
Additionally, 2017 results benefited from the final assessment of 2016 risk adjustment and reinsurance for ACA-compliant products
Based on our updated 2017 adjusted EPS projection, and the combination of these two items, we believe Aetna's 2017 baseline adjusted earnings to be approximately $8.75 per share
While we are still working through our planning process, we have incorporated a number of challenges in our forward outlook
From an adjusted revenue perspective, these include the previously-disclosed sale of our U.S
group life and disability businesses, the previously disclosed Medicaid contract exits, our exit from individual Commercial products and our continued repositioning of our ACA-compliant small group Commercial products
We project these top line challenges will also pressure adjusted earnings in 2018. In addition to these items we project adjusted earnings growth to be pressured by the reintroduction of the industry-wide non-deductible health insurer fee, creating a headwind of approximately $0.25 in 2018 due to the timing of revenue and expense recognition
We also expect this reintroduction to produce incremental experience rating pressure in our large group insured products
For 2018, we do see a number of opportunities, including our projected above-industry growth in individual Medicare Advantage and strong growth in group Medicare Advantage products, the full year impact of 2017 capital deployment action, and the potential to deploy additional capital to improve adjusted EPS growth, the reduction of losses from exiting individual Commercial products in 2018 and our ability to achieve expense efficiencies as we continue to simplify our processes and drive for best-in-class business performance
In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2017 and continue to plan for 2018, we are encouraged by what has been a strong adjusted EPS growth year in 2017 despite some top line challenges
We also remain confident in our ability to drive long-term adjusted EPS growth over time
I will now turn the call back over to Joe
Joe?
Josh, I think your overall characterization of 2018 and 2019 is correct
And when you think about a lot of the spending that we've been doing, especially in the second half of the year, a lot of that actually has been more pointed at 2019 growth, particularly in Medicare for example, with ongoing geographic expansion
A lot of the expenditures we're doing around analytics and technology and digital platform are also things that have a multi-year sort of growth dynamic to them
So I think when you think about 2019, we would largely think about Medicare continuing on that above-industry growth trajectory that it's been on
I would continue to think about our large group core business as sort of being in that mid single-digits, which they've largely been on
And what will be a driver I think around 2019 actually will be Medicaid
And if we can get back on the low double-digit track of Medicaid earnings growth, then obviously we're making some investment there around sort of our procurement and re-procurement processes
But that I think will ultimately turn out to be the linchpin around sort of the degree of growth for 2019.
Just recall, Kevin, that obviously there's a dynamic here of going on of the move to alternate funding, right, which sometimes we're saving some of those members but they're in a reduced revenue profile
The other thing I would say that I think has happened this year is when we look at that business, we've largely got that business back into a target margin range, and so I think the repositioning is more successful than just sort of the revenue line might indicate on the surface
A fair amount is coming
I mean, we're getting both
It's both large group and small group but there's a fair amount of strength in the underlying small group move into that market
So let me be clear about 2018. I think, in response to Josh's question, I was concurring that it wouldn't be a growth year
I don't think I said that it would be a down year
I do think it's important to – on these revenue issues, right, we have a good handle on what the revenue is
The individual exit is a little north of $1 billion
The Group Insurance divestiture is $2 billion
The Medicaid exits are probably approaching $2 billion
So there's a lot in this repositioning there to sort of hold flat
I think, as we mentioned, some of what we did this year was to try to accelerate SG&A spending and spend it in lieu of maybe spending it in the future
We've done that
Some of the spending that we've ramped up this year won't recur
But to your point, I think in this business, when you're challenged on the top line, you just really need to take the action on the SG&A line through your productivity measures and elsewhere, and I think that will be part of sort of the roll forward for having a successful 2018 will be managing this deleveraging
What we've tried to do is actually characterize it as other people have characterized it in this cycle
So what I would say is it's a combination of sort of the accounting dynamic that exists this year and then the effect of this next year
As I've mentioned before, this is – money is fungible and so this is all about – you can put it 100% into pricing, but it's about whether you get your overall aggregate price at the end of the day
So this quantification was sort of intended to pick up both dynamics
And I continue to, as we've talked to people as this has played out obviously, the group Commercial, the large group place is the space to sort of watch this, because I think the absolute level of rate increase matters
And we're having obviously a good year on Commercial, and so I think that is going to create some challenges in terms of sort of how much of that will flow back through the experience rating process
I'm just saying the absolute rate increase matters, and as we try to sort of manage that dynamic through the experience rating process, I think it creates pressure on the overall sort of renewal rating process
So, Christine, when you start to recover this, you're always making provision for what is the estimated revenue base you're going to have to recover this from
And so in doing that we normally buy ourselves some breathing room and anticipate that we might have some of this
So that dynamic though is captured in the $0.25 when we look at it
I think we've done a pretty good job of positioning ourselves for sort of how this has played out
I probably can't be overly specific at this point on that
I think the number you have is a little bit high
We have been dragging a little bit on the top line this year, and that impacts that ratio as well going forward
So some of it, as I mentioned in a previous question, sort of managing that spend as well as other actions, that will be part of how we bridge from 2017 to 2018. So it will be a meaningful part of the equation, but that's – we're working through our planning process right now, so I really can't be more specific at this juncture
Yeah, and I think, Chris, the fact one of the cleanest places to sort of see this is when we talk about large group
And when you HIF-adjust sort of that revenue, we're right there in the mid single-digits for revenue growth
And I think that's a very good indicator of sort of the state of the market around this issue
Yeah
So we've had that target out there in the past
So let me be clear, because we're close enough to 2018. I'm not providing 2018 guidance
We're just too close to that for me to comment specifically, but what I would go back to is this adjusted baseline of $8.75 and think about the drivers forward off of that
And, again, I continue to think about capital deployment, because we will do a lot – we've done a lot of that this year
That will have an annualized benefit next year, plus we'll have next year's capital deployment
So that should be a meaningful number for next year in the overall equation
And we've talked about some of the challenges around experience rating and the health insurer fee and things like that, but, again, we do have some good opportunities on Medicare and the exiting of the individual business
So from that adjusted baseline going forward, and I think we're feeling pretty good right now
Well, let me talk to you about the general investments in MA, and then we'll address the PBM one
First, it's about geographic expansion
So we have really good same-store growth
We need more stores
And so it is our intention to get into the 80%, mid 80%s coverage over the next few years
And we're on a ramp
Part of the – one of the biggest parts of our investment is ramping the ability to build out networks
And we're actually using very interesting data analytics to figure that out as well, using the Medicare database
And so this whole idea of expanding more markets is going to generate future growth
Now the other is that we've got 30% of the people that retire every day, 11,000-ish that only take Medicare Advantage, 70% don't
In large part that 70% is related to network coverage and portability
So for 1/1/2018 we will have launched a portable Medicare Advantage product across our current network, which is approximately 62% coverage, where we will test out some of the aspects in certain markets of having this kind of coverage and learn more so that when we get ramped up to that mid 80%, we will have an ability to offer a nationally portable Medicare Advantage product
And that, we'll go after that 70%
Star ratings getting to 4.5-Stars, 5-Stars with some of our big ACL relationships is a big idea
And then back on the PBM side, we continue to develop a relationship across our network
We have the ability to build our own network where we're getting the best cost structure we can get to provide an affordable product for seniors in the PDP and MAPD product
