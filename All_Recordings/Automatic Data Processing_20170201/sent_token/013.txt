Accordingly, we continue to expect new business bookings growth in the second half of fiscal 2017, but in light of the second quarter decline, we have now revised our outlook and now expect to be about flat for fiscal 2017 as compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. The client experience remains a priority for us whether it's through investments in our service model, in innovation and the user experience or in our efforts to upgrade clients with the most appropriate strategic based platforms, we believe that we have the right strategy to address these continuously evolving needs and opportunities and we remain pleased with the progress we are making
