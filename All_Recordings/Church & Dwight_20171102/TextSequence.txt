Good morning, everyone
Thanks for joining us, today
I'll provide some color on the quarter, and then turn the call over to Rick Dierker, our CFO
When Rick is finished, we'll have a Q&A session
So reported growth was 11.2%, which reflects strong organic growth and the Waterpik acquisition
We're very pleased with the organic sales growth of 3.2%
That was driven by 7.1% volume growth domestically
Our targeted investment spending has translated into share growth, as 7 out of our 11 power brands exceeded or met category growth
Both the International Consumer business and the Specialty Products business turned in really strong numbers
We're on track to achieve 8.5% full year earnings growth
Our International Consumer business exceeded our expectations with 6.2% organic growth
As you know, we continue to invest in our international business to sustain our long-term algorithm of 6% organic growth
Last year, we opened new offices in Singapore and Panama to support our export business
In August of this year, we established a new subsidiary in Germany to expand our European business
And over the last 12 months, we have been taking a hard look at Asia and the best approach to that region
There will be a lot more to come on this topic in the future
Our Specialty Products business had a strong quarter with 7.5% organic growth
dairy farm profitability remains at a higher level than a year ago
We are starting to get more traction outside of dairy in poultry and cattle
The acquisition of the Agro BioSciences business earlier this year is an important building block for animal productivity business
We've seen good growth for the probiotics products – that's a tongue twister
We have seen good growth for the probiotics products in the poultry industry and our new business development efforts in the dairy industry are translating into new sales
Turning, now, to some of our domestic categories, the laundry category declined 30 bps in Q3, driven by higher promotional levels and slower unit dose category growth, yet our laundry business grew 380 basis points in consumption
Once again, we were able to grow share in the quarter
That momentum has carried into October – and by the way, October promotional levels have also come back in line
ARM & HAMMER liquid detergent grew share for the 31st consecutive quarter
OXICLEAN laundry detergent gained share sequentially with improved efficacy claims and packaging
And now, finally, unit dose, behind our new Triple Chamber unit dose innovation, our consumption has outpaced the unit dose category rate for the sixth consecutive quarter
In Q3, ARM & HAMMER unit dose grew six times the category rate
Our total unit dose share, all in for all brands, is now 4.9%
In litter, the clumping litter category grew 4.6%, and the ARM & HAMMER consumption grew 5.4% and gained share
Our new litter innovation, SLIDE, has already reached 4% share (3:47) of the clumping litter segment and we grew share 60 bps in the quarter
SLIDE has a greater six-month repeat customer purchase rate than the last 14 category launches that we've had, except for Clump & Seal, which is slightly better
So, we feel good about the future of the SLIDE product
The dry shampoo category grew 33% in Q3. The dry shampoo category is now $140 million in the U.S
BATISTE grew 9.5 share points to a 33% share
BATISTE has the strongest brand loyalty of any dry shampoo in the category, including brands with significant hair care heritage
Now turning to gummies, the adult gummy category grew 13% in the quarter, while our business grew consumption approximately 2%
vitafusion, which is our adult gummy business, is contending with significant competitive discounting
There's been a lot of BOGOs going on in gummy vitamins
We haven't been participating, so that's been slowing our growth
The condom category declined in consumption by 2.7% in the quarter
TROJAN Condom share in measured channels was down, although some of that is offset by online consumption
As we discussed in our Q2 call, younger people are having less sex, plus we're seeing an increase in use of non-latex condoms
Innovation is always a catalyst to category growth
Our new XOXO condom, which is geared towards women, is going very well
Finally, we closed the Waterpik acquisition in the quarter
We were attracted to Waterpik because it has a bright future as consumer awareness of the importance of gum health continues to grow
Next up is Rick to give you some details on Q3 results and the outlook for the rest of the year
We said on prior calls that our – the three big brands that generally drive the international business are STERIMAR, BATISTE and – I forgot the third one
FEMFRESH, yeah
STERIMAR, BATISTE and FEMFRESH
In addition to that, in North America, ARM & HAMMER has been growing really well for us, ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, both in Canada and in Mexico
You know, as far as the business goes, the business is extremely healthy and we've had broad-based growth across virtually all of our countries in the third quarter
As I said before, our long-term algorithm is for the international business to grow 6% annually, and we're confident that we can deliver that
As far as my comments earlier about Asia, so Asia-Pacific is extremely attractive to us
It has a growing middle class
I mean, the countries we'd be most interested there would be Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand
And with a growing middle class using increasing consumption of personal care products, and our products are under-represented there, so we're looking at consolidating our resources in that area, making more investments in the future
You're only the second question in, Kevin, so you didn't miss it
So, our categories in the first half of the year grew 1.5%
That's ticked down a bit in the third quarter; a little over 1% for our categories, so – and we expect the same for Q4, and I think that's reflected in our full year call, up 2.5%
The other piece of that is international
International has had big growth for three quarters
They're going to be much lower in the fourth quarter, and that's – it can be somewhat lumpy in international, and one of the reasons for that is because of export
We have lots of different countries, so it doesn't always come in that evenly
It's no reflection of our long-term expectation of international, but international will be part of the story for the fourth quarter and why we'd be a little bit short
No, we came in at 6% – 6% and change organic for the quarter for international
It's early – we had a big first quarter for international, so it's a little bit lumpy
So, it'll be our lowest quarter of the year, but it's just going to fall over into 2018.
We didn't get into that level of detail as far as the net sales growth in the quarter, but what I can say is – what we had said is it's going to grow above our evergreen target of 4%
The business did perform well in August and September
So, we think that this business is going to be a big part of our story going forward
Some things we've learned, it's a very innovative culture; 20% of the business is online, which might be astonishing to you
It's sort of very sophisticated in how to sell online
I would think international is a big opportunity, because only $50 million of their business is international today
And of course, we have a $700 million business in international
So, we have a lot of leverage that we can help those guys grow their business
So, it's – we're very happy with this acquisition
The integration is going very well
Integration is not dependent upon people as much as it is a focus on how we can leverage the Church & Dwight with the suppliers and, also, the networks that we have internationally to grow their business
Yeah, tapering pricing in this environment is very difficult
I mean, generally the only categories you're going to be taking price in is where you have a clear number one share, and even then, you need to have a story with respect to input costs
So, that would be, for example, in condoms for latex
So, I think price – pass-through of input costs is generally difficult
Typically, what you see is changing in quantity sizes, in ounces and units in a package, is how you're going to get price
Hey, Jason
You can always ask a question, Jason
Yeah
Well, as you know, Jason, we only give our outlook every February
So, we have no intention of giving a 2018 outlook today
What I can remind everybody of is that we have an evergreen target of 3% organic growth, annually, and that target is based on Domestic growth of 2%, International of 6%, and Specialty Products of 5%
And the Specialty Products of 5% is driven by the fact that, over the last couple years, we bought a couple of businesses, one was VI-COR, the other Agro BioSciences that got us into things other than dairy, so we're expecting a lot of growth from that business going forward
Well, we're already seeing those trends in the fourth quarter
We're seeing that both vitamin consumption and condom consumption has improved from quarter-to-quarter
Now, we can – it's a little early with respect to answering your fourth quarter question when XOXO could be part of that story for condoms
And obviously, we had some new innovation on the vitamin side of the business
BATISTE, of course, is in dry shampoo, has been a rocket ship for us
You might have probably heard on my comments that that category grew 33% year-over-year in the third quarter and, at the same time, we grew share tremendously and we are at 33% share
That's a category that's $140 million
And if it grows as fast as the UK and where the UK levels off, it will be a $300 million category
So it gives you a little bit of color on three categories in Personal Care
I think the way to think about categories is you got to look at the volumes
So, the volumes are healthy in a lot of categories, so the real story is, when it comes to dollars, it's simply price; and, that's going to vary from category to category
And typically, it's much greater in household categories than it is in personal care, but as long as volumes stay healthy, I think that's a good barometer
So, I don't think that the price is something that is going to last permanently, but certainly it's something we're all dealing with now
Yeah
As far as your question on Waterpik, as I said before, it's a really impressive group of people that run that business
And when it comes to working online, it's early days, but what we've seen with respect to their development of web pages, the development of content for online, their social listening skills, the fact that they're already focused on Amazon, have sales on Amazon in Europe, they've been in it for – and more sophisticated than we've been for a number of years
So, we do think we can learn a lot from these guys
As far as is there any one specific category that would benefit, I mean, certainly it would be Personal Care more than Household because Personal Care lends itself more to online sales than Household
But it's a good question and we're very happy that these guys are now part of the family
Hey, Caroline
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
on the acquisition – Good morning
Thanks
On the acquisition contribution outlook, it just seems that the contribution was bigger than we had expected in the past quarter
So, if you could just give us a sense from a sales standpoint whether you see that Waterpik is coming in ahead of plan? And then, staying with Waterpik, what percent of the sales come from sort of electronic – the gadget part and what percent from the replacement part that's more the annuity business, and just what's the cycle there? Just a little deeper understanding would be really helpful
Yeah
Sure, Caroline
On the second one, in terms of the mix between units versus replacement, it's predominantly units, okay
It's a very small percentage that's replacements
That's not really as applicable at this time, right
Maybe that'll change one day in the future, but right now, it's largely just the replacement units and it's like a three-year replacement cycle, in general
So that's why innovation is so important, but that's also why category penetration is really the driver behind that business
And then, your first question was on Waterpik and just the contribution
We're not going to give details of the businesses; we just don't
That's not our past practice
We haven't done that with any acquisition, whether it was Avid, Orajel, or OxiClean
I'm trying to be as clear as we can, but for EPS it's a neutral impact for the year and that's what we're going to stick with
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
Got it
And then, just within the – you touched a little bit on the pricing environment and couponing, but are there any metrics you can put around what's going on in the vitamin business and just help us understand what the – how long this price war might continue?
Yeah
Well, look, when it comes to vitamins, the category is healthy
There are a lot more competitors out there right now than when we first bought the business, so there's lots of options for consumers
The space has expanded, as far as when you go on shelf, and the space has expended largely for the existing pill brands that are now creating gummy products and expanding gummy products, like Nature Made, Nature's Bounty, Centrum
And there's a fair amount of brand loyalty when somebody switches from pills to capsules, and BOGOs are exacerbating that transition
So, we haven't been engaging in the BOGOs, which as I said, is affecting our ability to grow
We do have a new ad campaign right now to try to break through the noise in the gummy category and we do expect to be up in the fourth quarter
But yeah, it's concerning and something that we continue to watch, Caroline
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
Just lastly on that, is Amazon a major player there? Because one of our fears – and I think investors across the board are just wondering which categories is Amazon going to become a big private label player? And are you seeing them in any of your categories at this point?
I mean, in gummy vitamins, we're the number one gummy on Amazon
In fact, our shares are super high in Amazon in comparison to what they are in bricks and mortar, so no worries there right now
Caroline Levy - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
The reason for that is private label today in laundry, and has been for a long, long time, is generally mid-tier
It's not a deep value
And if you look at the long-term trends, mid-tier has been the share donor to premium and to value detergent for a long, long time
And the reason you don't have a value in private label is because you already have deep value laundry detergent products on shelf, and so it's very difficult to make any money in deep value and come in as the opening price point below an extreme value laundry detergent
So, yeah, private label laundry detergent really is miniscule in the U.S
I wouldn't say it's a distribution game
It's really more innovation
So, the folks at Waterpik are experts in water jet technology
And just as they have the number one share and really own the water flosser category, they also have the number one share in replacement showerheads
So, there's – regulations typically affect the replacement showerhead business
In other words, the number of gallons per minute, today, generally around 2.0; that's going to go lower in the future
Question is, do you have the technology to deliver the same consumer experience that you did when you had a higher water flow? So, it's – to go back to your question, it's not a distribution game
It's really an innovation game
I'll give you an example of innovation
So, one of the new products is a Pet Wand
So, you know that more people have pets than children today, and that continues to grow
So, it's getting behind that particular trend
So, its translating their technology in the shower into a wand for washing your pets
And to answer your second question, in my time with the company, we have looked at bigger transactions than the Waterpik transaction, which is our most recent one
And as far as other structures go, yeah, we're no strangers to visitors from the major banks coming in, proposing combinations with various companies in the past through other structures, which we'd always be open to to the extent that it is going to create shareholder value
But that's about all I could say
Yeah
As far as how you react to a competitor move to take price down, typically it's IRCs, immediately redeemable coupons, those are things you can act on pretty quickly
As far as trade deals with the retailers, usually that's going to be six months out
Well, thanks for joining us today and we'll see everybody in February with the 2018 outlook
