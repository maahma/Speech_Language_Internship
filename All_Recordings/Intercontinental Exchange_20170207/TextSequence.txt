Thank you, Jeff, and good morning to everyone
As you can see on slide 5, we delivered a strong finish to a very successful 2016 despite a challenging environment
Fourth quarter revenues of $1.1 billion were up 5% year-over-year or up 7% on a constant currency basis
We will refer to revenue growth on a constant currency basis due to the significant decline in both the pound and the euro reflected in fourth quarter and current spot exchange rates
Adjusted operating expenses in the quarter were $493 million, down 3% year to year and below the midpoint of our guidance by roughly $10 million due to currency impacts and additional synergies
Adjusted operating margins increased 4 points to 57% and adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $0.71 on a pro forma basis
Moving next to slide 6, revenue growth in the fourth quarter was driven primarily by our data and listings segment where revenues were up 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis
Data and listings revenues grew 6% on a constant currency basis when you exclude the acquisition of the Securities Evaluation and CMA businesses
Notably, recurring revenues were 54% of consolidated revenue in the fourth quarter
And you'll also see that margins in this segment expanded to 52% in the fourth quarter
Within the data and listings segment, pricing and analytics revenue was up 14% year-over-year or 4% on a constant currency basis and excluding the businesses acquired from S&P
We continue to benefit from solid customer retention and are starting to see improvements from the reorganization of our data sales force and continued product development
Exchange data revenue grew 12% over the prior fourth quarter as we continue to see growing customer demand for this important risk management tool
Finally, revenue in our desktop and connectivity business increased 7% year-to-year on a constant currency basis, as more customers chose to buy larger ports to consume increasing amounts of the data that we provide
Turning now to slide seven, our trading and clearing segment revenues were up 3% year-to-year on a constant currency basis, driven by 10% volume growth
Energy revenues grew 9% on a 12% increase in ADV
Our financial revenues declined year-over-year due largely to currency impact and despite 9% growth in interest rate ADV
Operating margin in the trading and clearing business expanded by four points to 63%
Open interest in Brent, WTI, European natural gas and our agriculture and equity index products all reached record open interest levels in 2016. We expect continued geopolitical and market volatility to cause our commercial customers to carefully manage the risks associated with their open positions as we move through 2017. However, volume this January was down compared to the prior year trading volumes that were driven by the extreme volatility in January of 2016. Next, on slide eight, I'll recap our full year results
Consolidated net revenues were $4.5 billion, up 4% over the prior year or up 6% on a constant currency basis
Trading and clearing revenues grew 2% or 4% on a constant currency basis
Data and listings revenues grew 7% with the addition of revenues from the Securities Evaluation acquisition effectively offset by currency impacts
In addition to growing the top line, we delivered synergies of $120 million, $50 million more than we anticipated at the beginning of 2016, which contributed to adjusted operating margins expanding by four points
The combination of revenue growth and expense discipline drove adjusted earnings growth of 11% versus 2015. Importantly, these strong profit results generated record operating cash flows of $2.1 billion, which allowed us to increase our dividend payments by 24% comparing to 2015, even as we reduced our leverage from 2.8 times at the end of 2015 to 2.2 times at the end of 2016. I'd like to take a moment to expand on our approach to capital allocation on slide nine
Our capital allocation philosophy is straightforward
After reinvesting in our business and funding select, strategic growth investments, we balance our investment grade rating with the return of 100% of our excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases
One year after acquiring the NYSE, we returned nearly $1 billion per year in both 2014 and 2015. Similarly, one year after acquiring IDC, we expect to return over $1 billion in 2017. Underpinning this growth in capital returns, this morning, we announced an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend
We have now raised our dividend by double digits every year since we instituted it, which is consistent with our commitment to grow the dividend as we grow
We also plan to increase our share repurchase activity from $50 million in the fourth quarter to $200 million in the first quarter
We expect to continue to use repurchases as a primary means of returning an increased amount of capital to our shareholders during 2017. Our confidence in the strength of our business model and the sustainability of our cash flow enables us to invest in our business, maintain our solid investment grade rating, and significantly increase our capital returns only one year post the acquisition of IDC
Please turn to slide 10, which highlights our track record of delivering sector leading and consistently improving returns on invested capital
We have a disciplined process around M&A analysis and integration
We look to strengthen the companies we acquire by integrating them closely into ICE's operations to unlock greater value over the long term
Our process measures each business case against our goal of delivering double-digit returns on invested capital; meaning that returns generated are expected to be well above our cost of capital
While each business case is constructed with a view to creating long-term value, the foundation of success is established in our growth, integration and synergy plans which create positive returns above our cost of capital in the near-term
I should also point out that we consistently evaluate our portfolio
If a business no longer fits our strategy or is not helping us meet our ROIC target, we will divest that business
We did it with Euronext and with NYSE Technologies and expect to divest IDMS during the first quarter and NYSE Governance Services later this year
While good businesses in their own right, they don't meaningfully leverage ICE's core competency or have our strong margin expansion profile
The results of this disciplined process are reflected on this slide
ROIC has consistently improved in the three years since we acquired NYSE
We expect to deliver a similar trend of improvement as we execute the integration of our recently acquired data businesses
Finally, it's worth noting that our approach has enabled us to deliver nearly 140% total shareholder return to any ICE shareholder who has held our shares since December of 2012, almost double the return of the S&P 500 over that same period
I'll conclude my remarks on slide 11 by highlighting a few key elements of our 2017 guidance
Please refer to our press release and presentation for a complete summary of our guidance
Entering 2017, data revenues under contract are 8% higher than they were entering 2016, which gives us confidence that our data business can grow once again, at least 6% on a constant currency basis
While the various acquisitions and divestments we have completed or expect to complete during the first quarter will end â€“ impact individual data revenue categories, the net impact to our overall data revenues and expenses is expected to be immaterial
I also want to note that while we don't provide guidance for our trading and clearing segment, we are encouraged by open interest levels, strong commercial participation, new products and anticipated market volatility in 2017. Finally, I want to summarize our expectation for expenses entering 2017. We exited 2016 with around $100 million in synergies to go
We now expect to realize an additional $25 million to $30 million across our acquired data businesses
We expect to deliver roughly $60 million in synergies during 2017. Adjusted expenses are also expected to decline by around $30 million at current spot currency rates
The net impact to 2017 of the fourth quarter acquisition of the Securities Evaluation and CMA businesses along with the small data acquisition and the divestment of IDMS, which we expect to occur in the first quarter, will increase expenses by $8 million to $10 million
These additional expenses will be more than offset by incremental revenues of $12 million to $14 million
We also expect growth in variable expenses related to increased data revenues, additional investments in the resiliency and security of our broad technology footprint and increased compensation expenses as we bring IDC onto our ICE structure and as we reward our team for their consistently strong execution each consistent with our pay-for-performance culture
The net of all these ins and outs is that we expect our expenses to be roughly flat in 2017 versus 2016. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand the call back to Jeff
Yeah
So, Mike, thanks for the question
There's a lot tied up in that and if I miss a part, let me know
So, let me start on the last question
The share guidance reflects only those repurchases that we would expect in the first quarter, the $200 million that we talked about on the call
We don't project our forward repurchases and therefore we don't project it in the share count
So that maybe why you're seeing the share count be relatively flat offset with the grants, as you talked about it
More importantly, in the script, I want to be really clear about this
What I said was return over $1 billion this year, not $1 billion
And so, you're going at the right starting point
So, even if you just assume similar cash flows to what we had in 2016 and the timing of certain cash flows can vary back and forth; that was over $2 billion
If you net out of that CapEx, you're looking at free cash flow of $1.8 billion
We talked about $475 million of dividends with the increase that we put in
We're probably about $400 million give or take a little bit of debt reduction to get to our leverage target
That leaves us substantial amount of money for share repurchases
And Jeff was very clear, we've got a $950 million authorization
We've come out strongly in the first quarter with $200 million and I said explicitly that it's our intent to return 100% of our free cash flow that we don't need for investments in the business or dividends to our shareholders and that'll likely come through repurchases
So, I think the expectation for this year should be a very strong capital return and frankly the most capital we've returned in the history of the company
It was actually in our numbers for 2016. If you looked at our Qs and Ks, we had disclosed that as we moved through the year
There're a couple things that I think are important to note there
Number one, the impact to your tax rate depends on the size of your pre-tax profit, and ours is significantly larger and so the impact from that change is a bit smaller, number one
Number two, be really careful because that is a presentation change
It has nothing to do with cash
And so, again, net-net, it's reflected in our tax rate in 2016, it's reflected in our guidance in 2017. It's a relatively smaller impact for us because of the size of the pre-tax profit we generate
It's a good question, Rich
So, the guidance is net of the acquisition of the S&P businesses in the fourth quarter, the divestment of IDMS, which we expect to close in the first quarter and a smaller data acquisition that we also expect to include in the first quarter
You net all of that out and it's roughly a wash
I said $12 million to $14 million of incremental revenue, which on a $2 billion database (sic) [revenue base] (28:11) is nothing
And so, the guidance of at least 6% growth nets all that in
Importantly, when the IDMS business closes and that new smaller data acquisition closes in the first quarter, you will see a reduction in revenues in the second, third and fourth quarter of about $12 million each per quarter
And associated with that is a reduction in expenses of about $10 million per quarter
So you get a sense of the margin profile of the business being divested and our comments on the script about evaluating our portfolio
So that is all netted in the expectation and again, at least 6% is on a constant currency basis
Currency right now looks like it's about 1.5 to 2-point hurt in 2017 versus 2016, if current spot rates hold
Yeah, it's good question
And we have back tested, if you will, the metric a bit and it's a good indicator
It's not a perfect indicator, nothing is, because as you move through the year, you look at new sales and what the trends are there, the mix of products that are being sold, et cetera, but it is a good indicator that's why I mentioned it
I think our confidence in our data business growing is supported by the metric, that metric being up 8% entering the year
And by the way, that up 8% is on an apples to apples constant currency basis, so it directly relates to the revenue growth
I think it's relatively more indicative of, if you will, the former IDC business
And I think it's important to note that that business, which is largely reflected in our pricing and analytics, we expect to grow two times faster this year than it did last year
And so, while the overall growth is at least 6%, the leader of that growth this year is going to be that pricing and analytics business
It's going to be for the reasons that Jeff talked about, with particular strength in Europe, with particular demand for more information around bond pricing, et cetera
And so, overall, my expectation, as opposed to this year, where exchange data was the faster growing segment, exchange data will be a solid contributor once again in 2017. But it's really that pricing and analytics business that will grow faster than the overall data revenues
And then it's going to be a bit of a mixed bag in connectivity and desktops as we move through the year
Connectivity, as I said, we're seeing more and more customers want more and more of our data and move up to larger ports, which is obviously going to generate revenue growth in connectivity
But, in desktops, that's where the IDMS business is, that business will be coming out in the second through the fourth quarter
And so, as you look at the year-over-year dynamics of that, it won't look particularly appealing, but again, that will be largely reflective of the divestment
So, hopefully that gives you a little bit of a flavor for the pieces underneath the total
Yeah, we actually put that explicitly on chart 11, so it's a $30 million benefit in our expenses just parceled through the year
So, Ken with the additional $25 million to $30 million that kind of leaves us toway I would think about it is we're going to get little less than half this year, and then, the rest of it in 2018 and 2019.
Hey, Chris, let me start, if you don't mind, just with a few data points
Look, as Jeff said, we have never tried to predict volatility and we're not going to predict it this year
But our open interest level for our total oil business was at a record-level at the end of 2016. And underneath the covers, our WTI business, record-level; our Brent business, barely off record-level; European natural gas open interest, record-levels; our agriculture and metals business, record-level open interest; our equity indices business, which grew really well in 2016, record open interest level
So, when I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we don't predict our trading and clearing revenues because we can't predict volatility, we feel good about where we are from an open interest standpoint
A lot of point talk about their volume growth and that's interesting, but not really relevant
What matters is where are your open interest levels, how much of your participation is commercial participants, what are you doing in terms of delivering new products to those customers
And if we look at the combination of those things, if there's a little bit of volatility, we'll grow a little bit, if there's a lot of volatility, we'll see some solid growth
So we feel good about the metrics, we're just not looking to predict volatility
The 5% that we put in the guidance includes everything
The at least 6% on constant currency includes everything
And again, I feel like we're missing the forest for the tree
This is a really good business where we've said historically we would grow similarly to what we did last year
We grew 6% to 7% last year
We're going to grow 6% this year
We're going to generate 52% operating margin and the pricing and analytics business, it's going to grow twice as fast as it did in 2016. This is a great business
And again, don't lose sight of the fact that I said at least 6%
And so that means we likely think more than 6%; similar to 6% to 7% meaning likely more than 6%
Well, we're in an appeals process around Trayport
So there's no update because we don't know the outcome of that process
As a result of that, I would say to you, it's a business we like
It's a good business and it's doing well
So it is included in our guidance consistent with our appeal that we should be the long-term owner of that business
