Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone
Let me start by saying that 2016 was truly a significant year for Nasdaq, our businesses, our leadership team, and the geopolitical landscape
I'm very excited to have been named CEO and to have the opportunity to lead this tremendous organization forward during its next phase of growth and expansion
I would like to start by thanking Bob Greifeld for his incredible dedication and leadership over the past 14 years
Bob led a transformation that strengthened the company's foundation and then expanded it in a logical, disciplined and progressive manner
It is because of his vision that Nasdaq is as well positioned as it is today as a leading global technology solutions company, serving the global capital markets
Bob's focus on shareholders was incredibly important to him and one that he engrained in the entire organization
This manifested itself in the company's tremendous efficiency, as well as the outstanding shareholder returns the company has delivered over his tenure
I know that Bob appreciated the insight and support he received from you throughout the years
I fully intend to continue Nasdaq's focus on our shareholders, as well as our clients
Most importantly, our emphasis on delivering strong, consistent shareholder returns, while providing our clients with world-class exchange and capital market solutions across the globe
Having been in this role for a month now and having spent time with key personnel in many of our businesses at their annual sales and strategy kick-off sessions, we are very excited about our prospects in 2017, and my confidence in this organization's ability to continue to execute has only increased
Today, I want to organize my remarks around a few of the areas where Nasdaq is evolving our business, as well as cover some performance highlights from 2016 and then end with our execution priorities for 2017. As I noted, 2016 was indeed a significant year of progress for Nasdaq
We welcomed several additions to the business and executive leadership team, all of whom share strong expertise in their respective areas
I have the utmost confidence in the leadership team we have assembled today and their ability to move Nasdaq forward
Moving ahead for us means that we are constantly evaluating our businesses and our client engagement and finding the best path to success in serving our clients in a unified and strategic way
With this goal in mind, we've decided to group Listing Services and our Corporate Solutions business under one segment called Corporate Services in our reporting
Bringing these two businesses under one reporting segment will allow the investment community to gain a better understanding of the full range of services we offer our corporate clients as well as highlight the unique value we deliver to them
We strive to be a strategic partner to our 18,000 corporate clients throughout their lifecycle, both as private and public companies
And we intend to build further on the momentum in this area through increased collaboration and innovation across the teams at Nasdaq
We are also now reporting Market Technology as an independent segment
This change will provide investors with a clear view of what we consider one of the most differentiated and compelling aspects of Nasdaq's business model
We are very excited about the growth and expansion opportunities in Market Technology as we become an increasingly important partner to other markets, broker dealers and institutional investors
We are also making significant changes in our Fixed Income businesses
Under new leadership, we are bringing our fixed income offerings together under one common brand, Nasdaq Fixed Income, as we begin to evolve the strategy to better support both our clients and our growth objectives
While it resulted in a non-cash accounting impact in the fourth quarter, which Michael will detail, we're confident the business will be better positioned moving forward
Lastly, in terms of our business alignment actions, we have decided to end the NLX European rate futures initiative and we'll be working with our clients and partners to facilitate an orderly wind down of open positions
Now moving into the broader results for 2016, we are proud of the accomplishments that we achieved for our clients throughout the year and the resulting financial performance for our shareholders
Specifically in 2016, we delivered record of raw net revenues of nearly $2.3 billion, record non-trading segment revenues of nearly $1.5 million and record non-GAAP EPS of $3.68, an increase of 9% year-over-year
Building on this with our dividend payments and valuation improvement, Nasdaq achieved double digit total shareholder return of 17.5% in 2016. This performance is a testament to the strength of our model, our team and our ability to execute against a mixed volume backdrop
Recognizing that 75% of our revenues comes from subscription and recurring revenue businesses, I'll speak to the non-trading segments first
We continue to see steady organic growth across each of our non-trading segments, which together delivered 4% organic growth in 2016, a figure that is consistent with both our track record over the last several years as well as our forward-looking medium-term outlook
This was driven in special part by accelerated growth in our Market Technology segment, which delivered a very strong 11% organic growth for the year along with strong momentum exiting 2016 in terms of the fourth quarter's robust new order intake of $136 million, one of our highest quarters ever, capping a very solid $276 million total for the year
Breaking down 2016 order intake into how we delivered for our clients included deepening our relationships with existing clients such as contract extensions and in some cases contract expansions with the Hong Kong exchanges, Australian Stock Exchange, NEX formerly known as ICAP, SIX Group, Borse Dubai, and Borsa Kuwait, and significant new customer sales from clients such as NYIAX and the Affinity Capital Exchange among others
In conjunction with our trading business, we are particularly excited to announce in the fourth quarter our agreement to support and host a leading bank's dark pool as part of our Ocean initiative, a new way of leveraging our expertise in trading and compliance support solutions to solve customer challenges
And we look forward to building on this success in coming periods
Along with Market Technology's new order intake success in 2016, we were also excited to announce the Nasdaq Financial Framework or what we call NFF, which is our new modular architecture that will provide next generation capital markets capabilities, including the integration of Blockchain technology across the issuance and settlement of securities as well as cloud-enabled trading and clearing capabilities
We expect this next generation platform to contribute meaningfully to our order intake in 2017 and beyond
In our Corporate Services segment, we are very pleased to see solid progress in terms of improving our competitive position as a result of our continued client focus
In particular, issuers continue to see Nasdaq and our listing value proposition as the preferred venue for their public offering
This is evidenced in our 73% win rate across, among U.S
IPOs in 2016, including an 87% win rate in U.S
Tech IPOs, as well as, our success in large tech deals, in fact, seven of the top 10 technology IPOs selected Nasdaq in 2016, including amazing companies such as Trivago, Nutanix, and Coupa Software
We also attracted the largest Energy IPO of the year with Extraction Oil & Gas, and the largest bank IPO with First Hawaiian bank
We believe the investments and enhancements we've made to the IPO open experience coupled with our Corporate Solutions and our long-term orientation to our listing relationships are truly differentiating our offering
In the Nordic, DONG Energy and Nets, were two of the largest Nordic IPOs ever, and two of the top three IPOs globally last year
With 62 IPOs in 2016 and over €8.5 billion raised, we are very proud that our Nordic markets topped all other European regions
Lastly, Nasdaq became the fastest growing venue for ETF listings, delivering 50% year-over-year growth in our total number of listings with an increase of 110 Nasdaq ETF listings
In Corporate Solutions, we made significant progress to enhance the client experience through the introduction and rollout of the next generation IR platform, IR Insight platform
In doing so, we created an architectural foundation for all of our next generation Corporate Solutions products going forward
The IR Insight launch and rollout and other product enhancements combined with the continued improvements in our service and support all contributed to the ability to improve our organic revenue trends
Our revenue performance in Corporate Solutions stabilized as we progressed through 2016 culminating in modest, but encouraging organic growth in the fourth quarter
Turning to our Information Services segment, it continued to provide solid gains in 2016. The Data Product's business specifically delivered a 7% revenue increase for the year, most of which was organic
Our Index Licensing and Services business on the other hand experienced a challenging start to the year due to beta headwinds and fund flows and market performance
But we progressively improved as the year went on with assets under management ending the year higher versus 2015. As we look to the future in Information Services, we're encouraged by the progress in leveraging emerging technologies, most notably machine intelligence, to expand the ways we serve our clients such as, including the launch of the trading and analytics product suite, which is just beginning to leverage the machine intelligence in its logic
The new family of solutions offers, includes offerings that our clients use to refine their trading strategies or identify potentially alpha-generating investing areas
We continue to launch new Analytics and Insights products throughout 2017 and into the future as a way to generate new growth opportunities for us moving forward
We also continue to make strides in expanding our Index franchise, in particular with our smart beta products, which make up 44% of our growing, $124 billion in AUM total
An example of this was launching the first fixed income product leveraging the DWA relative strength methodology in partnership with State Street
Now turning to, from our non-trading segments to the Market Services segment, it was a mixed year
In terms of beta drivers, the first three quarters of the year were characterized by low volatility and volumes, an obvious challenge, although volumes picked up post U.S
election
In terms of our alpha drivers, we experienced a continued fierce competitive environment for market share in U.S
Equities and Fixed Income, while we made some late year gains in market share at Nordic equities and U.S
Specifically in our U.S
options business, we believe the ISE acquisition provides us with significant upside in how we serve our options trading clients, in particular in the complex order business and in our front end
We began to see the benefits of the combined options business, as we went through the year, and we've worked closely with our clients to begin to see new order flow achieving market share north of 40% entering 2017. Additionally, Nasdaq CXC are recently acquired Canadian market, provides new ways to leverage our core trading expertise in North America
NFX, our energy futures market continues to demonstrate a positive trajectory in the year-and-a-half since its launch
Open interest reached a peak of 1.6 million contracts in January of 2017 a new high
Volumes averaged 170,000 contracts per day in the fourth quarter, and we are averaging about above 200,000 per day so far in January 2017. We entered 2017 with a clear opportunity to add to the 140 clients who have already traded and we continue to identify additional products to bring to market
Overall, we are proud of our progress and accomplishments for 2016 across the businesses and how we are positioned to continue the momentum as we enter the New Year
Shifting to the execution priorities in 2017, there are three in particular that I've communicated internally and we'll share today
First, is to remain intently focused on completing the integrations of the 2016 acquisitions, so that we can provide the full benefits of these investments to our clients and shareholders
As of the end of the fourth quarter in 2016, we've achieved $38 million in realized run rate cost synergies and we continue to have high confidence we can deliver the full $60 million total by the end of 2017. Second, is to commercialize emerging technologies in meaningful ways for our clients and shareholders most notably in the areas of machine intelligence, Blockchain and the cloud
Leveraging our investments in the Nasdaq Financial Framework and the new trading and analytics platform, we will progress our commercial offerings in areas where we have the most compelling client opportunities
Third, is to improve our competitive positioning across all of our core businesses through continuous innovation and best-in-class client service
In my view, client centric innovation service coupled with a return orientation to our investments are the best means to secure our future growth
Of course we're going to have to navigate the macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop in 2017. Looking very specifically at the most critical areas and matters that will impact us, our industry and our broader clients
Our initial areas of focus will be financial regulation, tax reform and broader trade and immigration issues given that we are a global business
In closing, at Nasdaq, we are always focused on our future and the new ways in which we can serve our clients better
While we support our clients in a variety of different ways, technology has always been and will continue to be at the forefront of what we do
As a global capital markets infrastructure and technology solutions provider, Nasdaq has one of the most unique sets of capabilities in the industry
We use these capabilities to enable entrepreneurs and innovators with new ideas to find the capital they need to grow and expand
We use the capabilities to enable investors and intermediaries to buy and sell financial assets with ease and efficiency
And we use the capabilities to help the entire industry mitigate risk
All of these result in more constructive interactions with the capital markets, which as we've seen over the decades creates jobs and drives economic growth
The management team and I are very focused on the importance of our role in the global economy and how we can best continue to leverage our unique strengths to advance our clients and visions
I want to reemphasize my excitement about leading this tremendous organization
I fully intend to bring the progress and success that Nasdaq has achieved, and I look forward to taking our company, our business and our brand into the future to reach new levels
I look forward to working with and collaborating with all of you, as well as our clients and key stakeholders as we embark on this exciting journey together
Now, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details
Thank you, Michael
So, we are ready for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning
So the first question is what was the margin of Corporate Solutions for the year and you're very close, it was 11% for the year
And in terms of the margin improvement, I would say that the majority of the margin improvement we did expect to receive or we do expect to receive through the Corporate Solutions business as we continue to consolidate our platforms and kind of go down the roadmap that we established at our Investor Day back in April
We fully intend to continue to do that and we do see some significant efficiency benefits coming from that over the next year
But I also would say that as we continue to grow our Market Technologies businesses, particularly the surveillance business, there are opportunities to continue to scale in that business
But that's a, I would say that we have also – we're also making some investments in that business to make sure that we're positioning it for the next 5 years to 10 years of future growth
So there are some investments there in addition to the opportunity to scale whereas in Corporate Solutions there's a very clear path that we are undertaking to get to a higher margin
We do get net positive revenue from the NFX business, but we obviously have higher expenses than we have revenues
So therefore we would expect that – so the drag is really coming from the expenses as compared to the revenue intake so far
Okay, sorry
All right
Well, when we look at it specifically for the U.S
Treasuries business, I think that we see the opportunity for us to, first of all focus our efforts
So we had two initiatives that we had started to launch in 2016 that we've chosen not to continue to pursue, because we really want to focus on the core business and the core value proposition, that the Nasdaq fixed income business provides
And when we look at ways that we can provide our clients with better service or better capabilities, I think there are three things that we're focused on as we go into 2017. The first are some new critical order types that we expect to introduce in the first half of the year
The second is continued rollout of new assets into the platform and trying to get more volume into those assets, mainly off-the-run assets
And then the third is the potential for us to look at creating more of a direct connect between the dealers and their clients, but through some interfaces and networking that we can provide using our technology as opposed to having to have them have to build that outside in their own infrastructure
So there are ways that we are looking at continuing to build on the business that we have and we would expect that as we go through the year we'll start to see the benefits of that
We have not provided target margins for the Corporate Services business
What we will continue to provide you though is the Technology Solutions margin as it was prior – previously reported because of the fact that we've given you a target margin for that combined segment
So we want to continue to provide that transparency to you, and therefore, we will continue to provide that as we march to that 20% goal
But we're not providing a separate and distinct Corporate Services margin goal at this point
Right, and it's a combination of – it's margin improvement combined with – for a combination of both continuing to progress the business and the value proposition to the clients in addition to finding new efficiencies, yes
Sure
While we take a very strategic approach to looking at market data pricing across the suite of products that we have both in the U.S
and in Europe, and we take a very measured approach to looking at how we can generate value for our clients and therefore pursue some pricing changes in our products, we don't do a standard sweep of pricing increases on an annual basis, that's not our approach at all
But we do anticipate that the pricing changes that we have proposed and implemented in the market data business in particular will generate somewhere in the range of – I think around 2% growth, but it's not – it's not particularly significant, but it is something that we continue to pursue in connection with of course, growing the demand for our products, as well as introducing new products in the business
I don't think we've ever provided you a breakeven level specifically on contracts traded
We have a combination of growth in the contracts traded as well as continued work with our clients to effectuate some pricing increases, as we go into 2017, and through the year, and we are working in collaboration with them, to establish what those pricing increases should be, in connection with those products, where we've had a critical mass of market share
So that's a dynamic conversation that we have with our clients, but we – they are very aware of and supportive of us making certain pricing moves to continue to get to a sustainable level within that business, but it's going to be a combination of those pricing changes and continued growth in the contracts traded, and we've not provided any specific goals for that publicly
Thanks, Alex
So the first thing I would say is that we are obviously encouraged by the fact that we have gotten to the point of stabilizing the revenue and now experiencing some organic growth in the business
We certainly are hopeful that we can continue that momentum into 2017, and we are doing that sort of combination of a lot of things, one is continuing to improve and increase the value proposition to the clients to making – to make it so that it's more interesting for the clients to take our products or maybe expand our usage of our products as well as making sure that we can retain the clients because this is a renewal type of business, so that's very important for us to make sure that we can renew our clients every year
And then on top of that, we are making sure that we invest in certain innovations that make these types of offerings more compelling to them
In terms of what drove the fourth quarter specifically, we were – we found the highest growth in the advisory business, which is a part of our IR intelligence suite where we provide very detailed information around ownership levels for publicly listed companies, as well as in our board portal space, that continues to be a great growth business for us, and so those were the two drivers of growth in the quarter
In terms of pricing changes, we do do modest pricing changes, not across the entire suite of solutions, every year we make a determination as to where we believe that it's appropriate to do pricing changes, but we have, but they are very modest within the contracts they are very, we have a cap, it's somewhere in the range of anywhere from 2% to 3% and we have done those as we've gone into 2017, and that just kind of flows into the business
We don't make mid-year pricing changes as a general matter
So, well we are – we're very aligned with our clients, and so we spend a lot of time working with them to determine how best to enable them to effectuate their strategies within the options markets that we have
We now have, of course have six options markets, and a lot of different choices in how they can participate in the options business
So it does give them more opportunity to work with us to find ways to effectuate their strategies
We have had some of our larger clients choose to increase their participation in our market
We are very pleased with that, and that of course brings with it follow-on volume from other clients who want to interact with that flow, and that's been driving the increase
In terms of the contracts, the pricing per contract, the – there are volume tiers and others things in the market, so we would anticipate that as to the extent that they are bringing in more flow and creating and hitting certain levels that we might see a slight decline in the contract – pricing per contract as it has to do with the (39:35) incremental market share, but nothing dramatic
Well this is just a movement of the segments, but overall for the non-trading businesses we continue to project out that we have outlook of mid-single-digits growth across all of our non-trading businesses
I think that in terms of looking at how we've broken it out now, you can see that we believe that the Market Technology business has more of a mid to high single-digits opportunities, whereas the Corporate Solutions and combined with Listings continues to have more of a low single-digits growth opportunity for now
And I think that that's our outlook at the moment and we will continue to refine that as we continue to progress the businesses
Yeah
And in terms of buyback activity, as we've said, we've actually been saying this since the middle of last year
We will continue our buyback activity primarily associated with managing our share count, but we will also take opportunities when they present themselves to do buybacks as well
So order intake does tend to progress as you go through the year, and there will be certain years where we might have some large contracts signed earlier in the year
But for this particular year, we just found that a lot of our clients are kind of making these big decisions towards the end of the year
So we're very pleased with that
I think also the introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework did catalyze more conversations with clients, and that takes time for them to understand what we are presenting to them in terms of the next generation technology, and getting them to understand the value that it presents to them and their business, and that then also culminated in some sales later in the year
In terms of revenue conversion under the current accounting guidelines or the way that we account for that revenue today, it does, as you know we don't account for revenue until we've fully deployed the solution into the client
So that's why there was such a lag with Borsa Istanbul, in terms of when we signed the contract versus when we started seeing revenue earlier this year
And so, for these clients, these – I mean, across all of that order intake some of it will be – some of it will be recognized frankly within six months and some other of the revenue might not be recognized for another year or 18 months
But none of them are as big and complex as the Borsa Istanbul deal in terms of taking years to be able to show up in the revenue
Well, I would say that the conversations we've had with clients in terms of having them drive their volume into the platforms has not been specific to complex order functionality, but rather the overall value proposition we have between kind of the pro rata market, the complex market, and the price-time market
So, it wasn't specific to any sort of complex order strategies that they were trying to deploy
In terms of the pricing and we did make some moves earlier last year, leading up to the close and then right after the close, we did make some pricing moves across some of the price-time markets and those who were already – they've already manifested themselves into the pricing
And as of right now, that's kind of what we're carrying forward with us
Well, I would say that we continue to have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities across both our existing clients and new clients for our core market tech business
And just to remind everyone, the market technology business is really in three components
There is the core market technology business that we offer out to other marketplaces around the world; there's the smart surveillance business that's offered both to marketplaces and broker dealers and now also institutional investors around the world and then there's the GRC platform that's really primarily offered to corporate clients
So we do have a lot of different ways for us to penetrate our clients or grow our client base And I would say that where we're seeing a lot of opportunity, number one, is we have been working with new markets that want to launch in new asset classes that are frankly not necessarily financial asset classes
And so that's a really fun and exciting area, because we're able to leverage our core technology
And particularly the Nasdaq Financial Framework, because it's cloud-enabled, does allow us to essentially launch markets in the cloud now and that is kind of a very compelling offer to some new markets that are looking at new ways to generate liquidity in other asset classes, so that would include the two that I mentioned in my script
I think that then on the existing clients in the core market technology business, we have a healthy pipeline of clients who are looking to upgrade or really upgrade their existing platforms as well as broaden out what they do with us
So, where you can see with Borsa Istanbul, we had more than 10 components that they implemented with us, whereas some of our other clients were still working on one or two
So we do have the opportunity to expand across what we do with our existing clients and that manifested itself in some of the order intake that came in the end of the year
And then in the smart surveillance business, that continues to be a very high-growth business for us
We continue to penetrate the broker-dealer space with our surveillance offerings
We're now offering a key e-coms compliance combined with surveillance, total package using very advanced machine intelligence
And then we also have launched a buy-side platform, specifically for them in surveillance, and we already have some early clients working with us to implement that
So, we have a lot of growth opportunities across the businesses
So, I share Bob's general view that we need to take a balanced approach to looking at how we deploy our capital across the franchise
We focus on R&D and we've given you view as to looking at essentially somewhere in the range of 2% of our revenue
We're trying to make sure we're investing in R&D
I think that we also look at the capital return in terms of our dividend, and we're very committed to that, and I'll touch on that a little bit more in a minute, share buybacks
But then also making sure that we do take advantage of opportunities that are in the market to expand our business meaningfully, and provide good returns for you
We are very disciplined in the way that we look at the return profile on deals
I think that the deals that we've done over the last two-and-a-half years, since I've been here, I think reflect the fact that we are very, very focused on making sure we generate great returns to you as shareholders, but also really meaningful improvements in what we can offer our clients, and we will continue to do that as part of our strategy
In terms of dividends versus buybacks, again I think we do take a balanced approach to that, and we will continue to do that
We will provide any sort of updated guidance on our dividend in the next quarter, and that's all I'll say about that right now
Sure
Well, they will all be migrated onto that pricing next year in 2018. And so this year, it continues to be a voluntary program, and we have had the majority of our clients move into that all-inclusive fee, because it is very compelling for them, particularly if they do – they have any sort of share incidences (52:04) across, in their business
So, but we will be migrating all of our clients onto that new fee structure next year
I think that, well, we do have some restrictions in our ability to generate kind of pricing synergies across exchanges in the United States
The SEC, we have proposed the opportunity for us to provide pricing across our exchanges and try to leverage the fact that we do have great businesses in equities and options in the United States as well as in Europe
But, the – there are some regulatory restrictions to our ability to do any sort of cross pricing
In terms of though – in terms of the way that we work with our clients, in terms of connecting into our data center and leveraging all of the capabilities we have, I think that we do find that we have much deeper relationships with our customers because we can offer them an opportunity to trade across asset classes, the complex order functionality in ISC or in our options business now does allow them to create strategies across equities and options
And we actually are continuing to look at, particularly in the data products area, ways that we can look at the options data and make – and using machine intelligence find opportunities potentially in equities
So, there are things we can do, but we do have some regulatory restrictions because each of these exchanges are separate and distinct exchanges
Well, I think that the primary area of initial opportunity as we continue to deploy the blockchain and certainly the cloud, as well as, machine intelligence, I would say all are primarily focused in the Market Technology business because of the fact that the Nasdaq Financial Framework is cloud enabled and provides full blockchain capabilities from pre-trade risk management all the way to settlement
So we do have some near-term opportunities to leverage those technologies with clients who are paying to deploy those technologies within their markets
And so, we definitely see that as a good area of growth for us
I would say primarily in 2018, but certainly with order intake in 2017. And then, of course, with the SMARTS business we are fully integrating natural language processing machine intelligence capabilities from a partner into our solutions
And so that is a near-term, immediate term, and we already have on two clients signed up to do proof of concept with us and we do anticipate to have signed clients this year for that
And then on the Trading and Insights business, our platform, which is in our Information Services business, we are specifically working with several machine intelligence companies to leverage their capabilities to look at our data and find potential alpha signals within our data, as well as actually bringing in other third-party data into the platform
And it's a really fun and exciting area for us
That will take a while for that to manifest itself
We already having paying clients using some of those machine intelligence-driven products, but that's very early days, and we do anticipate continuing to rollout products over the next several years to grow that into a critical mass, but that is a long-term opportunity for us with some near-term revenue but against the entire revenue stream of GIS business, it will continue to be small in the short run
And then lastly in the Corporate Solutions business, we will be starting to work with the machine intelligence in the IR intelligence suite, and that's, we haven't yet done that though, so that's kind of right in the beginning of where we are looking at ways to innovate on the IR intelligence side of the business
I would say that we are primarily focused on organic opportunities
We may have the – we have made a couple of strategic and small investments into some interesting and growing technology companies most notably in the blockchain and machine intelligence area, and we may continue to do that
But at this point, we are focused on this being organic
We have been growing our team of data scientists
We have been growing our capabilities and our expertise in the blockchain
We have I think a spectacular technology team that really is working hard to make sure that we can create as many organic opportunities as possible across these technologies
So, we're very excited about it
And with regard to the, we call it Trade Management Solutions now instead of Access Services, but the connectivity fee filing that you're mentioning, we have amended that filing and we do continue to work with the SEC to get it to be approved
I think that it will – that the filing itself in terms of the proposal itself does not have a very significant impact on our revenue, it was a modest filing to begin with and it will continue to be a modest filing in its refined form
Well, I would spend a couple of minutes comparing NFX to NLX
I think that NLX, we do want to make sure that when we make investments in these types of things that we are finding every opportunity to succeed, and we are working very closely with the clients to understand whether they see a path to success as well
And with NLX, I think that as we went through last year and we continued to struggle in terms of building up open interest in the platform and we continue to have significant delays from LCH in their ability to support cross margining across the short-end, which only came towards the beginning of last year, and then, the long-end still hasn't arrived, and now they're delaying it even further
It really essentially created or eliminated the momentum in that business and we started to get the sense that they just – our clients did not see a path to success for the business
And then, I would say that now we can compare that to NFX
In NLX, we topped out at maybe 100,000 contracts of open interest in the platform and that was before last year
So last year we did not top 50,000 contracts in open interest
In NFX, we have almost 1.5 million contracts of open interest
We have daily volumes of, as I mentioned north of 200,000 contracts a day, we continue to onboard new clients
Our Market Advisory Committee is incredibly engaged and committed to the platform, they continue to push us to add new products onto the platform, they are continuing to bring other clients into the platform; it's been an amazing experience in terms of the motivation that our customers have in NFX to drive to a sustainable competitor in the business
They want to see competition in this business, they appreciate the fact that OCC has come in as a clearing house to support the business and they are very, very committed to us
So, it's just a totally different experience with our customers as we've looked at the juxtaposition of these two businesses
And, it was time – I think with NLX to say this does just – we don't see a path to long-term success here, whereas NFX we see, we do see a path to long-term success, assuming we can continue the momentum in the business and that continued commitments from the customers, which is really pretty spectacular right now
I think that in terms of looking at a path to profitability for NFX, just to refine Michael's comments, we do see a path to profitability
Do we expect that to happen this year? It may not, just, it all depends on how much growth we can get in contracts traded and how much of the pricing that we can implement as we go through the year
So, I just want to say that we continue to see a path, it may not be this year, it may be that we end up hitting that next year but that's certainly our expectation and our goal
Well in a business where we generate over $2 billion in revenue, the idea that we would commit $40 million to $50 million in R&D activities to me seems actually very, you could argue prudent, or you could even say that we can – we need to find even more opportunities for us to invest in our future
So I feel very confident and comfortable that we're making the right level of investment in R&D, I think that the key is for us to make sure that we are focusing our R&D efforts on things that we believe can generate the right long-term return on invested capital and we look at every R&D initiative going forward
We will look at it on – on a long-term ROIC
Now, organic activities and organic growth as compared to M&A
M&A tends, you tend to have a shorter time horizon for looking at the return of invested capital, because you're investing more capital upfront and you're buying an existing business and then you are integrating it quicker, whereas organic growth opportunities some might manifest themselves with an ROIC over three years, some over five years, and some over longer, but we need to make sure we know that going in and we look at that and calibrate what's the return we expect versus the investment and therefore how long are we going to give it to have runway to grow
And that's a very, very important focus for me and it is something that I'm extremely committed to working on with Michael to make sure that we are balancing that out appropriately as we look at new opportunities in the business
So I feel that and then on the capital return side, we've been extremely committed to returning capital to shareholders through a growing dividend that we've had, I think we've gotten to, I think a nice return profile for the clients -for our shareholders, sorry, on the dividend
I also think that we've been very opportunistic and strong in our share repurchase program
So I feel like we are returning a lot of capital to shareholders while we're also investing in our growth and that is the right way for us to run this business
And I think that that's we will continue to do going forward
Well, thanks everyone for your time today
I would like to reiterate that Nasdaq is operating on a very solid foundation across our business, in terms of our team, our technology and the offerings to our clients
We have opportunities across our businesses to leverage that foundation to continue to grow and expand our relationships across our broker-dealer, investor, corporate and exchange clients, and we are excited about our ambitions for 2017. So with that, thank you very much, and this concludes the call
