Thank you, Jamie
I am pleased to report that we are on track to meet our 2017 financial goals, with first quarter operating results right in line with our expectations
Organic revenue was up 2% globally
We delivered positive volume growth in both global snacks and global beverages, along with positive net price realization
And core constant currency EPS grew 7%
And despite the macro volatility and weak currencies in many of our key overseas markets that impacted our reported results, our organic revenue growth was driven by our developing and emerging markets businesses, with mid-single-digit organic revenue gains
We are particularly encouraged by the broad-based gains we saw in our two largest developing and emerging markets, Mexico and Russia, where growth across snacks, beverages and dairy led to high single-digit organic revenue growth in each of these important markets
And the developed markets, we grew organic revenue 1%, led by solid performance of Frito-Lay North America and North American Beverages
And we delivered this performance despite facing a few headwinds, including: the timing of the New Year holiday, which fell into the 53rd week of our 2016 fiscal year; a later Easter this year; and the delay of U.S
income tax refunds that dampened Q1 consumer spending across virtually every consumer category
With Q1 coming in line with our expectations, we remain confident in the full year 2017 outlook we shared with you last quarter, namely, organic revenue growth of at least 3% and core constant currency EPS growth of 8%
We are proud of the strength and consistency of our performance over the years and we expect 2017 to be yet another strong year of achievement
As I wrote in my annual letter to shareholders, our performance has been enabled, in large part, by our anticipation of and response to far-reaching demographic environmental and societal shifts
For more than a decade, it has been clear to us that if we wanted to make our future as bright as our past, we needed to transform our company in a number of critical ways
With changing consumer preferences reflecting a growing shift towards healthier lifestyles, we needed to continue to transform our portfolio to offer more nutritious products
With increasing strains on natural resources and the increasing importance governments are placing on protecting our planet, we needed to transform our operations to limit our environmental footprint
And we're changing attitudes, values and demographics in the workplace, especially as Millennials enter the workforce in large numbers
We needed to transform our workplace and our culture to make sure we were meeting the evolving expectations of a new generation of associates
The urgency of responding to these shifts is what gave rise to the approach we call Performance with Purpose
From the start, Performance with Purpose has been more than a slogan
It's been an overarching vision, guiding every aspect of our business
It's about building a healthier future for all our stakeholders
Of course, this begins with generating healthy financial returns for our owners, but that is just the table stakes
Our challenge is to deliver them consistently and sustainably year after year
And the way we are doing this is by continuing to transform in five areas: first, making healthier foods and beverages for our consumers
To meet the evolving needs of our consumers around the world, we are shifting our portfolio to a wider range of what we call: first, Everyday Nutrition products, which are products with positive nutrients like grains, fruits and vegetables or protein, plus those that are naturally nutritious like water and unsweetened tea; and two, what we call guilt-free products, which includes the Everyday Nutrition products plus beverages with 70 calories or less from added sugar per 12-ounce serving and snacks with low levels of sodium and saturated fat
As a result, today, more than 45% of our net revenue is derived from guilt-free products
And our Everyday Nutrition portfolio is growing faster than the balance of the portfolio
This transformation has been enabled by a series of critical investments in R&D that are paving the way for new flavors and sweeteners, as well as ingredients and recipes
And we are also investing in advanced manufacturing technologies, like our proprietary frying innovation that can reduce the amount of fat in potato chips by 20%
You see our commitment to our product transformation and our recent innovation around the globe
For example, in North America, we just launched LIFEWTR, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste
The brand fuses creativity with design to serve as a source of inspiration by featuring the works of some of today's top visual artists on the package
We also launched LEMON LEMON
It's a sparkling lemonade, a modern take on an old tradition with bubbles, lemon juice and a touch of sweeteners, with just 70 calories per 12-ounce serving
We launched IZZE FUSIONS, a next-generation sparkling beverage, modernized with unique flavors and just 60 calories per 12-ounce serving
And we're expanding the lineup of our highly-successful Smartfood Delight popcorn, that contains just 35 calories per cup
It's made with air-popped 100% whole grain popcorn, contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives and offers gluten-free and non-GMO project verified varieties
In Brazil, we are launching new Quaker fruit bars made with oats and real fruit
Quaker fruit bars are just 60 calories per serving, have no added sugar, has zero trans fats and are a source of fiber and Vitamin C
In Russia, our J7 whole fruit line, containing 100% fruit juice and nectars with the fiber of a whole fruit, hit the market earlier this year
In Mexico, we are expanding our global Sunbites franchise with the launch of three product forms, multi-grain chips, popcorn and plantains
And in the UK, we launched Quaker Super Goodness in two forms, SuperGrains and Super Fruits, both made with 100% whole-grain oats with beta glucan, which has been shown to lower blood cholesterol levels
And we believe there is much more room to grow in the space
For example, working with our retail partners, Quaker Foods North America has the opportunity to return to growth by leveraging one of the most beloved nutrition distribution brands to renew excitement in the center of the store through innovative merchandising
The second area is generating healthy growth for our retail and foodservice partners
As a result of all the investments we have made to position ourselves for success over the long term, from anticipating consumer trends to building a robust innovation pipeline, to transforming our product portfolio to meet consumers' needs, we are delivering top-tier growth for our retailers
For the third consecutive year, PepsiCo was the largest contributor to branded retail food and beverage sales growth in the U.S
In fact, in 2016, we generated more retail sales growth than all other $5 billion-plus food and beverage manufacturers combined
We're driving growth by leveraging our global scale and driving excellent local in-market execution
For example, in 2016, we placed with our retail partners more than 250,000 single-serve displays dedicated to our fastest-growing brands with our best innovation, driving growth in single-serve beverages for our retail partners and us
By implementing the GES model pioneered Frito-Lay, our North America Beverage unit is improving order accuracy, reducing out-of-stocks and driving even greater levels of in-store service
To drive growth with our foodservice partners, in just one year, we placed 20,000 Hello Goodness branded vending units that offer consumers access to foods and beverages from across the PepsiCo portfolio that meet certain nutrition criteria
And we are building a powerhouse e-commerce team, creating global capability in markets from the U.S
to China to the UK and tailoring that capability with retailers to fit their growth strategy
Third, we are contributing to a healthier planet while boosting our bottom line
One of the central planks of Performance with Purpose, the vision we set out over a decade ago, has been protecting our planet and conserving natural resources
We continue to advance these efforts in a number of ways, including responsible water use, shrinking our carbon footprint across our supply chain and reducing our waste and packaging material, not only because it's the right thing to do, because it's the smart thing to do for business
I am pleased to report that globally, approximately one-third of our plants have now achieved near-zero waste landfill while reducing, reusing or recycling their waste
And our efforts continue
In January, we activated a wind turbine at our Skelmersdale plant in the UK, which is now providing 25% of the site's electricity with this renewable energy source
These and many other environmental sustainability initiatives are not only shrinking our environmental footprint, they're also substantially reducing our costs and boosting the bottom line
The fourth area is creating a healthy workplace and culture for our associates
The extraordinary men and women who make up our company are our greatest assets
That's why we're committed to remaining a place that the best and brightest come, not only to earn a living, but to build a life by fostering a healthy workplace and culture
So we've undertaken a broad set of initiatives: to build a work force that's diverse and inclusive; to provide working caregivers the support and flexibility they need to meet their responsibilities at work and home; to foster learning; and to promote more effective ways to work together
For example, in North American Beverages, we've declared 2017 to be the year of the frontline leader and launched frontline leader excellence training to our almost 3,000 frontline managers, with topics covering employer advocacy, time management and career building
And at Frito-Lay, we are piloting innovative programs to address the continuous need for skilled labor by creating a variety of programs aimed at skill development for our current associates as well as partnerships with local technical schools for development of future talent
Our workplace and culture are more than the product of corporate policies
It also reflects our values, holding ourselves to the highest standards of excellence, speaking with truth and candor and selling only products we can proudly stand behind
And the fifth area is promoting healthier communities wherever we operate
Although we're thought of as a global enterprise, we are also members of every local community where we do business
Our associates live there, we make our products there and we often source our raw materials there
For all of these reasons, we have a stake in the local communities we serve and we work hard to meet our responsibilities to them
An important way we contribute to our communities is by creating well-paying jobs, along with the possibility of long, successful careers
We are also doing our part to be a good neighbor in other ways
For example, in Chicago, for over a decade, we've been the title partner of the largest high school soccer tournament in the U.S
, the PepsiCo Showdown
In 2017, there are 216 Chicago area high schools and more than 21,500 student athletes involved in the event, which is built around the theme Make a Difference On AND Off the Field
Relatedly, there is a monthly community service push with the thousands of PepsiCo Showdown student athletes to cultivate leadership for a brighter future
And throughout Mexico, our Entrepreneurship for Growth program supports youngsters from vulnerable communities to improve their quality of life, to develop enough soft skills through sport and hard skills through technical education
So taken together, these steps form a virtuous cycle that's powering our ongoing transformation as a company, enabling us to do well by doing good and positioning us for success, not only over the short term but also over the long term, adding to both the durability and duration of our shareholder value creation
So net-net, we feel good about the state of our business
We are on track to deliver our full-year financial targets
And we are managing our business to both the short-term and the long-term in a way that delivers healthy, sustainable returns to our shareholders
With that, let me turn the call over to Hugh Johnston
Thank you, Lauren
Let me just say that, clearly, in the first part of the quarter, several things happened
One is the fact that the New Year build up into the 53rd week of 2016 and then we had the slowdown because the tax refunds were delayed
By the time we got to the end of the first quarter, the business started to pick up again
So we aren't really concerned
It's just a timing issue
I'd just say globally, our business is looking good
Let me quickly give you a snapshot of what we are seeing globally
Europe is doing very well
The return to growth has been impressive, so we are feeling very good about Europe, across all parts of Europe
The Latin American continent, outside of Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, is good, but Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela are causes for concern
The Middle East is retooling itself, and we have to wait for it to figure out how they're going to come out of the oil price decline
China, the GDP growth is good
Our snacks and nutrition business is doing very well, and our beverage business is slowly recovering
And India is coming out of a bold demonetization now to remonetization
There's good GDP growth and we feel good about our business prospects there, too
is concerned, as we head into the second quarter, we don't have a reason to be worried
Morning, Ali
You know, Ali, those are all very good questions, but every one of these concerns can also be reframed as an opportunity
And that's really what we do because if PepsiCo's business is over-developed in C-stores, we look at expanding in grocery and other channels, whether it's foodservice or vending, as a bigger opportunity
And then we look to see how we can leverage our DSD system to grow our business into new categories in C-stores
And that's what has made us more valuable partners to convenience store retailers
And in terms of difficulty with impulse on online, we've built a very good e-commerce business
It's growing at impressive rates
I don't want to discuss those rates, but it's growing at impressive rates
And clearly, our challenge is to create impulse online
And we are working on tools with all of our partners to make our categories look like impulse categories online
It's a work in process, but I must tell you that our growth rates are quite impressive
And in terms of health and wellness and impacting the snacks business, look, snacks are simple pleasures of life
What we are doing is making our snacks more permissible
We're reducing the saturated fat levels
We remove trans fats
We're reducing the sodium levels
If you're going to eat a snack, eat a PepsiCo snack
And there's nothing wrong with eating a snack that's guilt-free
So our goal is to offer you a range of options from sort of fun-for-you products to guilt-free products, which include Everyday Nutrition, both in a snacking form and in a food-like form
And at this point, we are singularly focused on growing the core, expanding out of the core but making sure across the board we make them a lot more permissible
And it looks like that strategy is working at this point
Morning, Dara
Morning, Judy
And we're already seeing the volume back
Morning, Andrea
Morning, Laurent
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Good morning, Indra
Question about Quaker
I mean, despite Quaker being one of the LTS of all (34:54) PepsiCo brands, it seems the top line has been soft for quite some time, now including this quarter
At the same time, operating margin have reached a new high with 27.4% in the quarter
So could you please give us more color on this business segment and is this first quarter kind of a reflection of what we should see for the entire year?
Great question, Laurent
I'd say the Quaker business internationally outside the United States is doing very well
Solid growth, we are entering new markets
It's doing very, very well
, the Quaker North America numbers that you see includes the Quaker hot cereal, which is where the Quaker brand is housed
And then all of the other businesses that go within Quaker North America, including Rice-A-Roni, Pasta Roni, Aunt Jemima, there's a whole bunch of other businesses, ready-to-eat cereals
One-third of the business is the Quaker hot cereals
And the Quaker hot cereals business, I'd say, over the past few years, has been flat to very slightly down
And the only reason why the overall portfolio looks negative is because it's center store business in grocery stores
And the overall center store category is down high single digits, sometimes even low double digits in some quarters
And so while we are outperforming the center store categories handsomely, I think our next challenge is how do we leverage our relationships with retailers to reinvent center store
And that's a conversation we've been having with some of the retailers to say how can we help you rethink the center store so that we can bring growth back to that category
And we need to do that in order to bring interest back to that whole cereal aisle and, therefore, Quaker
By itself, Quaker remains a much-loved brand and it's profitable
And our hope is that with the rejuvenation of center store, our categories grow, too
I think to talk about elasticity on a category basis is too general, Vivien
I think we look at elasticity sub-segment by sub-segment
And all the pricing we've put in place in the U.S
is very carefully looking at the elasticity curves
And we look to see what kind of pricing the consumer can adopt, what kind of volume impact it will have and what can we sustain as a portfolio
And I think that what you're seeing right now is pricing that was sensible for the first quarter
And as the year goes on, I mean, look, we put the pricing in place in Q1, or in fact, I'd say Q4 we started putting the pricing in place, and that's ticking through the year
And we modify that as we go along if we believe that we need to change our promotional calendar to accommodate the consumer trends
I don't know, Hugh, if you want to add anything
Hi, Robert
No change in tone of business, and I think consumer confidence continues to remain as positive as we've seen it
Morning, Kevin
Thanks, Kevin
Look, at the end of the day, we oppose beverage taxes that are regressive and unfairly target one category or industry
I think, unfortunately, today's beverage taxes are more revenue generation-focused rather than health-focused
But whatever the reason be, from our perspective, we are working on two things: one, making our portfolio deliver products that are lower in sugar and a lot of zero sugar products and beverages with positive nutrition
So that's one part of our strategy, and we've been working on that for 10 years
The second part of our strategy, making sure we bolster the rest of the portfolio outside of beverages
So when taxes do come in, we can cushion the effect through managing the portfolio in a more intelligent way
And that's been our strategy over the last decade because we anticipated some of these trends early on and we started to re-tool the company for that
So at this point, let me just say that our strategy is crystal clear and we feel comfortable as to where we are headed
So let me just close by thanking you all for your questions
To summarize, we will continue to manage everything within our control to deliver attractive results in the short-term as we continue to position the business for long-term success
Thank you all for joining us this morning and, more importantly, thank you for the confidence you've placed in us with your investment
