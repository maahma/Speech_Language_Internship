Thank you, Hikmet
Third quarter reported revenues of $1.4 billion increased 2% compared to the prior-year period or 3% on a constant-currency basis
The impact of currency translation net of hedge benefits reduced third quarter revenue by approximately $8 million (07:38) compared to the prior year
In the consumer-to-consumer segment revenues increased 1% on both the reported and constant-currency basis from the quarter
Transactions grew 2% led by strong growth in westernunion
com
Total C2C cross-border principal increased 4%, or 2% on a constant currency basis
Principal per transaction increased 1%, or was flat constant currency
The spread between C2C transaction growth and revenue growth in the quarter was 1% with no impact from currency
Mix had a negative impact of approximately 1% in the quarter, while pricing was flat compared to the prior-year period
Turning to the regional results for the quarter, I will be referring to constant-currency movements as I discuss individual country contributions to the region's results
North America revenue increased 1% on a reported and constant-currency basis, while transactions grew 2%
outbound growth driven by sends to Latin American and Caribbean countries was partially offset by a weaker trend in the U.S
to Mexico businesses
domestic money transfer business originated at retail locations declined due to price reductions and softer transaction trends
Although, we continued to see good domestic growth from westernunion
com
In the Europe and CIS region, revenue increased 2%, or 1% on a constant-currency basis, while transactions increased 7%
Revenue growth was again led by France with mixed results from other countries across the region
In the Middle East, and Africa, South Asia region, revenue declined 8% in both reported and constant-currency terms while transactions were down 11%
The revenue decline improved relative to second quarter's rate, but we still experienced the impact of soft conditions in the oil-producing markets
Total inbound business to India was down approximately 10% in the quarter which improved sequentially from a revenue decline of about 15% last quarter
Weakness in the Middle East send markets continued to contribute to the decline
In the APAC region, revenue declined 1% or increased 1% constant currency while transactions were flat
In the Latin America and Caribbean region, Argentina and several other South American markets continued to drive very strong growth
Revenue increased 19% in the region or 22% constant currency on transaction growth of 17%
com C2C revenue delivered strong results again in the quarter with revenue growing 23% on both a reported and constant currency basis driven by 24% transaction growth
com represented 10% of total C2C revenue in the quarter
Business Solutions revenues grew 2% or 1% constant currency, including a negative 3 percentage point impact from the loss of the XE
com business
Revenues benefited from good growth in key verticals such as universities and NGOs, but this was partially offset by continued declines in sales of hedging products, partially due to lower FX volatility in key markets
Other revenues increased 9% in the third quarter, or 13% on a constant currency basis
Other revenue growth was driven by Speedpay in the U.S
and the Pago Facil walk-in bill payments business in Argentina
The bill payments businesses represented over 85% of other revenues in the quarter and our Speedpay U.S
electronic bill payments business is the largest component
Turning to margins and profitability, the consolidated GAAP operating margin in the quarter was 19.3%, which compared to 20.2% in the prior-year period
Adjusted operating margin of 20.6% in the quarter compared to 21.7% in the prior year
The margin decline in the quarter was primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense and increased marketing spend
Adjusted metrics in the current quarter exclude $10 million of WU Way expenses and $8 million related to an accrual for estimated cost of an independent auditor which was required by our January joint settlement agreements with federal and state government
The prior-year quarter excludes $5 million of WU Way expenses and $15 million of accruals related to the joint settlement agreement
We achieved approximately $11 million of savings from the WU Way initiatives in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date savings totaled to $12 million
We now expect approximately $25 million of savings for the full year, up from our previous estimate of $20 million
Full year WU Way spending is expected to be closer to $95 million, down from the previous estimate of $100 million
Currency negatively impacted operating profit in the quarter by approximately $9 million compared to the prior-year period
Foreign exchange hedges in the third quarter had a negative impact of $2 million due to the strengthening of the euro and other key currencies, which compared to a benefit of $12 million in the third quarter of 2016. For the full year, we now expect approximately $5 million in hedge benefits
Compliance expense was 3.5% of revenue in the third quarter
We now expect compliance expense for the full year to be closer to the low end of the 3.5% to 4% range in our outlook
EBITDA margin of 24% in the quarter compared to 25% in the prior-year period, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.3% compared to 26.5% in the prior-year period with the decline attributable to the same factors as operating profit margins
The effective tax rate in the quarter was 1.5% compared to 9.6% in the third quarter of last year
The adjusted tax rate was 3.6%, which compared to 11.7% in the prior-year period
The tax rate in the quarter reflects discrete benefits related to statute of limitations expirations on certain reserved items
Our full year tax rate outlook has not changed, as we continue to expect full-year tax rate outlook has not changed, as we continue to expect the gap effective tax rate to be approximately 10% to 11% and the adjusted rate to be approximately 12% to 13%
GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 in the third quarter increased from $0.44 in the prior year period, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 increased from $0.47 in the third quarter of last year
The C2C margin was 23.5% compared to 25.1% in the prior-year period
The margin decrease was primarily due to higher incentive compensation-related expense and increased marketing spend
Business Solutions operating profit margin was 9.1% in the quarter compared to 4% in the prior-year period driven by operating expense efficiencies and lower depreciation and amortization which were partially offset by higher technology expense
Depreciation and amortization for Business Solutions was approximately $11 million in the current quarter compared to $13 million in the prior-year period
The Business Solutions EBITDA margin was 19.7% which compared to 17.5% in the third quarter of 2016. Operating margins for the businesses included in other revenues was 10.5% in the quarter which compared to 10.1% in the prior year
The year-over-year margin improvement was driven by revenue growth and technology efficiencies, which were partially offset by higher compensation-related spends and higher bank fees in U.S
electronic bill pay
Turning to our cash flow and balance sheet, cash flow from operating activities was $423 million year-to-date
This includes outflows of approximately $600 million from payments related to the settlement with federal and state governments and WU Way spending, net of associated tax benefit
Capital expenditures were $47 million in the third quarter
And at the end of the quarter, we had debt of $3.5 billion in cash of $1 billion with approximately half of the cash held by United States entities
During the quarter, we issued $100 million of five-year notes with a coupon of 3.6% and $250 million of floating rate notes due in 2019. We returned $180 million to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $80 million in dividends and $100 million of share repurchases, which represented 5 million shares
The outstanding share count at quarter-end was 459 million shares and we had $956 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization
Based on our results and recent business trends, we are affirming the outlooks for operating margin and increasing our earnings per share and cash flow outlooks compared to our previous outlook reported on August 3. We are increasing our outlook for GAAP revenue slightly to reflect a more favorable exchange rate while the constant currency revenue outlook has not changed
We now expect GAAP revenue growth to be a low-single-digit increase, a slight improvement from the previous outlook of flat to low-single-digit increase
Given favorable profitability trends, we are increasing our adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $1.75 to $1.85, up from $1.70 to $1.80 previously
GAAP earnings per share, which has also been increased to a range of $1.50 to $1.60 compared to $1.46 to $1.56 in our previous outlook
Both earnings per share ranges reflect an approximately $0.07 negative impact from foreign exchange compared to the prior year, down slightly from our previous projection of an $0.08 negative impact
We are increasing expected GAAP cash flow from operating activities to approximately $600 million primarily due to tax-related items, better-than-expected working capital changes and increased profitability
On the tax items, the approximately $100 million of anticipated final tax payments related to the 2011 IRS agreement are no longer expected to be paid in 2017. In addition, this year's cash flow is benefiting from a tax refund related to prior-year overpayment and other lower than expected tax payments
Excluding the impacts of the settlement agreement payments and WU Way spending, expected operating cash flow for the full year would be approximately $1.2 billion
So to summarize, we are pleased with the solid business performance in the third quarter
We generated strong profitability and cash flow, continued to return significant funds to shareholders and increased our earnings per share outlook for the year
Operator, we are now ready to take questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Hi, Tien-Tsin, this is Raj
We are guiding to approximately 20%
So it could be a little bit above or around that range, it really depends on how the spending goes in the fourth quarter
We have planned for additional spend in marketing in other areas in the fourth quarter, so the margins are likely to be lower in the fourth quarter, but the overall margin for the year should be still quite solid
As you've seen
Yeah
On the mix impact of about 1 point in the quarter that's something that we have been seeing for this year
It's really hard to predict exactly where that will be
And it really just depends on where we're getting the growth and obviously the growth is coming from lower RPT corridors and lower growth in higher RPT corridors and if you look at last year it was about the same and then, in 2015 it was flattish in terms of overall mix impact
And the World Bank data, they adjusted their principal growth for last year and our principal growth was in line with what the World Bank showed and then for this year, they expect something just under 4% principal growth
Our third quarter, we grew about 4% in principal, so we'll see where we end up for the year, but we're tracking in terms of at least the third quarter
Darrin, we have, as you know, we have thousands and thousands of corridors, so we're always moving pricing in many of those corridors, sometimes up, sometimes down, but on a macro basis, it doesn't translate too much in terms of net change
But individually, individual corridors we're moving pricing for sure
Yeah
I would say both of those things are benefiting us
We didn't call it out specifically this quarter, but we're continuing to see good performance from both the absolute commission rates that we're seeing in the business as well as the mix benefits from just faster growth of our digital business that's continued to drive overall commission rates down, if you will so, that trend is continuing
Thanks, Darrin
I would say that, you know we're in the 3.5% to 4% range
Some of it is just timing more than anything else
But we're also trying to do things as efficiently as we can you know with technology and other solutions
So – you know we've been stable in that 3.5% to 4% range now for the last few years and you know so it's not – it's a relatively small range as you know, so that's we are still in that range
Thank you
And the dotcom business domestically continues to do very well and accelerated slightly actually in the quarter
I don't have a forecast for the spread, but some of it is continuing from the larger price reductions we had made in Argentina more than a year ago
So some of that is continuing, but overall I would just say the Latin America business is getting healthy growth across the board
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the conditions are quite strong there
We've seen stronger growth throughout that region more than we've seen in some time
I'd say I think it's mostly timing, we had been messaging earlier in the year that we were under-spending in marketing
And so now that's catching up with us, so it's as expected from a couple of quarters ago
We're launching a number of different programs on the digital side to acquire customers
We're also trying to create awareness at some of our other digital capabilities of paying out into accounts
So it really is more timing than anything else
Thank you
We don't believe that's really impacting us much
Obviously, we have 50,000 locations here in the U.S
; Walmart has 4,000. Walmart, what they did most recently was they reduced an already low price
And so it really remains to be seen on whether an even lower price is going to bring in more traffic into those stores
So we feel very good about our positioning
If you look at our nation-wide pricing, it's pretty competitive to the other offerings and distribution is very strong as well
So that's not really the key driver and DMT in total for us is about 7% of our total revenues, just to put that in perspective
And again dotcom continues to grow really well from a DMT standpoint and we saw some accelerated growth there
So we're well-positioned competitively
It's just timing
We have not changed our full-year outlook on the tax rate
So still 10% to 11% or 12% to 13% adjusted tax rate for the full year, which is the same as we gave last time
Well, there are three pieces to the North American business that you're looking at
One is, U.S
outbound and U.S
outbound continued to grow really well
We saw strong trends similar to what we saw in the prior quarter and that's the largest piece
domestic money transfer business, the retail part of the business did see some softness both in revenue which was driven by some of the price reductions we've made, but also some transaction softness
Some of it may be related to the hurricanes, but we'll see what that impact was as we get into the fourth quarter
It's hard to know exactly how much that was, but some of it may have been from the Hurricanes
to Mexico is also part of that number and the transaction trends there were a little bit softer as well
The overall market seems to be a bit softer in Mexico, that seems to be more of the impact
I mean, we'll give a view of the margins and the other components of our outlook when we go into next year, Jim
But obviously we like the fact that we're getting more savings that's positive for us
Revenue growth is still going to be the number one driver for us in terms of where overall margins are because our cost structure is about 40% fixed
But we also want to look at some of the investment opportunities
Our goal is to try to accelerate revenue longer term, so we do want to put some of the money back into growth opportunities
Hikmet talked about digital expansion globally
We want to be 200 countries to 200 countries digital to digital in our wu
So that requires investment
So, we'll see where we ultimately end up, but we like the strong margins we're getting this year and we want to continue to drive a good balance between investing and also driving good profitability
Hey, Ashwin
Ashwin, we came into this year expecting at the higher end because of some of the joint settlement agreements and the incremental activities, so the timing of some of those things have allowed us to be at the lower end
But we're continuing to invest as Hikmet said
Yeah
I mean, part of the reduction – sorry, Ashwin, part of the reason why we are at the lower end as you heard last time, we talked about the Southwest Border activities being completed early
And so that's something that we had not anticipated at the beginning of the year
So that's one of the reasons and then other efficiencies
It helps
Just operating efficiencies, obviously we'd rather get stronger revenue growth, that's our number one priority
But we've also been managing the bottom line in that business, just in the environment that we're in
So it certainly helps
But our number one focus there is still to drive better top-line growth
There is probably some pricing that's helping us there
We expected that in the second half of this year, we would start to get some grow-over benefit
Key parts of the Middle East started to decline in the second half of last year and then as we go into the fourth quarter, India, the demonetization that began in India in November of last year should start to grow over
And the Middle East is a key sending region to India and so that should start to help some of the actual metrics in the Middle East and India
So you should start to see a little bit better grow-over impact from that as we go into the fourth quarter
I don't know where it ranks, but it's still very important to – that's a very important corridor for us, Saudi to India
I don't know of its exact ranking, but clearly the top corridor for Saudi is to India
About two-thirds of our transactions are initiating in our mobile app on wu
So if that was your question on wu
com, about two-thirds of our business is originating on a mobile app and it's even higher in the U.S
And so we're getting very strong growth and we don't have mobile everywhere yet
So that's really the goal is to be mobile
How are you?
I mean, it depends on the trends that we see in other parts of our business
We'll start to see some grow-over benefit as I just mentioned in certain parts of our consumer business
We've continued to see good strong trends in our digital business
And our bill payments businesses have been doing quite well, both Speedpay as well as Pago Facil
So those are really the key drivers of growth, both from a constant currency and a reported standpoint and then of course currency is helping us from a reported standpoint
It can, it can
Over the long term, probably not, but in the short term, if there are extreme moves in currencies, then customers may change their behavior at times
When we saw the Indian rupee weaken some time ago or when we've seen the peso, we've seen a large influx of business into those markets
So currency moves in the short term can certainly have an impact on consumer behavior
Yeah, the way we look at the Mastercard partnership and paying out here domestically, it's really just another channel to deliver our services
We have dotcom today originating transactions which largely pay out on retail, this gives us the opportunity to pay out to all debit cards in the United States, and including Mastercard debit card
So, we'll have to see, we don't really have any projections to give you on that, because we just, we expect it to launch early next year
Thank you
No, the realized savings this year will be $25 million and we'll have an incremental $25 million next year realized
So total realized savings next year of $50 million
Well, the $95 million of WU Way expenses that we're incurring this year will go away at the end of this year
So the programs themselves we may continue, but we're not going to have the spending next year, so it's zero
Yeah, we've tried to call it out separately for GAAP margins and adjusted margins, just so you can see the difference that that's making
