Thank you, Bill
Let's begin with the leasing activity here on page 7. Our total bookings for the first quarter were a little over $50 million, including a $9 million contribution from interconnection
We signed new leases for space and power totaling $42 million during the first quarter, including an $11 million colocation contribution
The first quarter activity played to our strengths
We transacted in 21 of our 33 global markets during the first quarter and roughly 20% of first quarter customers transacted with us in multiple markets
Approximately two-thirds of our activity was concentrated in North America, with the balance evenly split between Europe and Asia
The quarter did not hinge on any one transaction
The largest single deal was just 3.2 megawatts and colocation and interconnection accounted for nearly 40% of our total bookings
We added 28 new logos during the first quarter and we signed over 200 leases for space and power
Including interconnection, we completed more than 900 transactions
First quarter wins included numerous signings from top cloud service providers, specialized cloud verticals and other vibrant customers driving the digital economy
Our wins included new customer deployments in new markets as well as continued expansion of existing customer infrastructure within our portfolio
These signings were both big and small and landed within our footprint of urban infill Internet gateways as well as larger scale campus locations across four continents
On the enterprise front, our wins included strong customer demand from both IT service providers, as well as numerous enterprise customers that came directly to Digital, including a large U.S
healthcare company, a multinational semiconductor and software firm and a global investment management firm
In terms of integration, we're off to a strong start in 2017. As mentioned on our last earnings call, we combined our European teams during the fourth quarter
In 2017, we're focused on consolidating our systems and streamlining our processes
You can see one byproduct from this process visible in the face of the P&L this quarter
We have collapsed the repairs and maintenance expense line item into the rental property operating expense line
We will do our best to minimize any external facing impact from the integration process
In this instance, however, the efficiencies gained, as we sunset multiple general ledger systems, were significant enough to make the changes worthwhile
In addition to general ledger systems, we have also unified our product offerings under a single Digital Realty brand and we expect to go through a product rationalization later this year
Our colocation expansion plans are underway and we're beginning to generate revenue synergies with customer wins and new cross-selling opportunities
We currently have in the works an expansion of our Service Exchange from eight U.S
markets to a total of 17 markets across our three major geographic regions by year-end
In addition, we will be rolling out Layer 3 capabilities in the coming months to enable SaaS providers on this Service Exchange
Finally, by the end of the year, we expect to have substantially completed integration of our recent acquisitions into our ongoing operations
Turning to our backlog on page 8. The current backlog of leases signed, but not yet commenced, stands at $79 million
The weighted average lag between first quarter signings and commencements remained healthy at less than three months, well below the historical average of approximately six months
Moving on to renewal leasing activity on page 9. Tenant retention was well below our historical average at 42% during the first quarter, driven by two somewhat unique move-outs
The first was a 3-megawatt deployment in Silicon Valley, previously occupied by an online gaming company, whose needs had shrunk
This capacity has been completely re-leased
The second was a Powered Base Building move-out in Atlanta
The single tenant customer had occupied the building for 13 years and had invested significant capital to build out a customized data center solution
We were unable to come to terms on a renewal
And while re-leasing this space will require both time and capital, the existing infrastructure provides a compelling opportunity to redevelop a Powered Base Building shell into fully built-out data center product at an attractive cost basis
Atlanta is a core data center market with competitive power cost and a suburban scale offering would be highly complementary to our dominant colocation and interconnection hub at 56 Marietta
This property is also adjacent to a 1 million square foot campus owned and operated by a top 3 cloud service provider
Preliminary project footing is underway and we expect to proceed with the redevelopment subject to market demand
Excluding these two special situations, our tenant retention during the first quarter would have been north of 80% across all property types
In terms of renewal leasing activity, we signed $46 million of renewals during the first quarter in addition to new leases signed
Cash re-leasing spreads were up 3.1% overall with a positive mark-to-market across all property types during the first quarter, including a solid double-digit cash mark-to-market on PBB renewals
We do still have pockets of above-market rents remaining throughout the portfolio, primarily in the Northeast region, so we may see a modest negative cash mark-to-market in any given quarter
On balance, however, cash re-leasing spreads were positive for the first quarter and we expect cash re-leasing spreads will likewise be positive for the full year in 2017. We continue to see gradual improvement in the mark-to-market across our portfolio, driven by modest market rent growth and steady progress on cycling through peak finished lease expirations
In terms of our first quarter operating performance, overall portfolio occupancy was unchanged at 89.4%
Same capital portfolio occupancy improved 40 basis points sequentially due to incremental leasing, primarily in the West region
You may recall that on the past couple of earnings calls, we've discussed taking assignment of a colocation reseller customer's PBB lease at 350 East Cermak in Chicago
And we mentioned last quarter that we're negotiating the lease to backfill roughly 25% of the space that will bring us back to breakeven
I'm pleased to report that we signed that lease during the first quarter and we expect to create additional value for our shareholders from lease up of the rest of this capacity over the next several quarters
dollar's steadied upward march leveled off somewhat during the first quarter
As you can see from the chart, at the bottom of page 10, however, the dollar was considerably stronger in the first quarter of 2017 relative to the first quarter of 2016, given the spikes following Brexit in June and the U.S
Presidential Election in November
As a result, while comps should begin to get easier in the second half of the year, FX still represented roughly 150 basis point drag on the year-over-year growth in our first quarter reported results from the top to the bottom line as shown on page 11. Same capital cash NOI growth was 3.4% on a reported basis for the first quarter and 4.2% on a constant currency basis
Core FFO per share grew 7% on a reported basis and was up nearly 9% on a constant currency basis
Core FFO per share was $0.06 ahead of the consensus although the first quarter may be somewhat of a high watermark for the first part of the year as you can see here on page 12. We don't typically give quarterly guidance but it's important to note that we expect the run rate to dip down in the second and third quarters before rebounding in the fourth quarter due to a combination of higher property tax accruals, higher G&A expense related to promotions, merit increases and timing of stock grants, as well as the settlement of the remaining 2.4 million shares subject to the forward sale agreements we entered into last May
In terms of the quarterly distribution, we expect the first and fourth quarters will represent a little over 51% of the full year figure while the second and third quarters are expected to represent a little less than 49%
We also expect to record a $0.04 Topic D-42 charge during the second quarter related to the redemption of our Series F Preferred Stock in early April
This non-cash charge will be excluded from non – from core FFO per share
As you may have also seen from the press release, we raised the low end of our guidance range by $0.05, reflecting the outperformance during the first quarter as well as our growing confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year
Let's turn to the balance sheet, beginning with our sources and uses here on page 13. As mentioned, we expect to settle the remainder of the forward equity offering at expiration on May 19. We also expect to realize up to $200 million of proceeds from non-core asset sales
In addition we expect to generate approximately $400 million of cash flow from operations after dividends
Finally, we expect to raise up to $500 million of long-term fixed rate debt
Given our recently expanded presence in Europe, we will most likely look to further our FX hedging strategy with a sterling bond offering later this year
In terms of uses of capital, we retired the final $50 million tranche of the 5.73% Prudential Unsecured Senior Notes at maturity in January
In April, we redeemed the $182.5 million liquidation value of our 6.625% Series F Preferred Stock
We are on track to spend $125 million to $135 million of recurring CapEx and $800 million to $1 billion of development CapEx in 2017. Spending on both categories ran below expectations last year, but picked up in the first quarter
In terms of the components of AFFO, we would also like to highlight the long-term trend in straight-line rent, as shown on page 14. This chart reflects several years of consistent improvement in data center market fundamentals as well as the impact of tighter underwriting discipline, which has driven steady growth in our cash flows and sustained the improvement in the quality of our earnings
Finally, as you can see from the left side of page 15, we have a clear runway with nominal debt maturities before 2020 and no bar too tall in the out years
We ended the first quarter with fixed charge coverage above four times and debt-to-EBITDA below five times
We expect debt-to-EBITDA to hover right around five times for the rest of the year
I'm pleased to report that S&P acknowledged the strength of our financial condition and the favorable industry backdrop as they revised the outlook on our BBB flat credit ratings to positive during the first quarter
Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth, consistent with our long-term financing strategy
This concludes our prepared remarks
And now we will be pleased to take your questions
Denise, would you please begin the Q&A session? Question-and-Answer Session
Jonathan, thanks for that question
We restructured our sales team in early in the first quarter, as Bill mentioned in his beginning comments
And what we did there was we decided to organize our sales team to sell to our customers in a way they buy, cloud service providers buy differently than enterprises and differently than network solution providers
What we've done is trained our sales team around these solutions
We've also hired skilled resources onto the team in order to make sure that we're providing expertise and solutions to our customers' opportunities and problems
And we're deepening those skills throughout the year
We saw some positive impact from that in the first quarter, as you can see from the strong sales numbers that we turned in
But we also expect that as our skills deepen and our relationships deepen and the strategy itself takes hold that we'll see continued progress as a result
It's not an overnight dramatic doubling of sales kind of an impact
But it, over time, will be the right strategic move
And again, we saw impact from that in the first quarter that we thought was very positive
I think it's important to note that we did do the restructuring at the beginning of the first quarter
It was a major restructuring and integration of the Telx, Digital and Telecity assets
And yet still turned in a strong quarter, which we feel very good about
So, first of all, the mix that we had in the first quarter, Jonathan, we were very comfortable with
Other than the fact that we want to grow our channel opportunities significantly over time, this balance of about 60% of scale business and 40% of colo business is one that we're comfortable with and we'd like to maintain over time
As it relates to channels and alliances, Bill mentioned in his opening comments as well that we did low single digits of the business that we did – booked in the first quarter through our channel partners
That is something that we're very focused on changing
I'm not going to give you a, necessarily, a percentage target of our sales right now that we'd like to generate through the channel, except to tell you that we'd like it to be meaningfully higher than that and I think it's probably safe to say that at some point in 2018, to make it double-digit portion of our bookings, the percentage of our bookings in 2018. We think that we can get there
Change of focus on channels and partners and alliances is a meaningful endeavor and takes new processes and methodologies for working with partners
The leader that we've hired from a top IT managed services provider, who has extensive channel experience, has that reengineering of our channel organization underway
And, I think, starting in the fourth quarter and certainly in 2018, you'll start seeing impacts that really matter in those areas, which will be positive
Jordan, this is Andy, maybe I'll speak to give you a little more color on the quarter, then let's see what you can get out of Dan on our pipeline
So if you look at the total amount of signings for the quarter, the – we had a similar concentration in kind of that SMACC vertical, which is cloud and other parts of the digital economy, which is about 65% of the total volume
What was a little bit different this quarter is that about – of that component, it was more heavily weighted to other parts of the digital economy relative to just the top cloud service providers
We still had a significant portion, I think, a third of that chunk I just described was top cloud service providers but there's a lot – there's a whole bunch of other parts of specialty clouds, other parts of companies that are part of the digital economy and have their businesses over the Internet, were a driver
And then rounded out, the other 35% of the total demand, was a combination of IT service providers and a host of other customers, which I'd probably characterized as enterprise
So, we really attacked enterprise customers two ways with our – a great group of IT service providers and also enterprise that come to us directly
That mix has been fairly consistent
But it did pick up a little bit at the end of the last year and into the first quarter
And I'll turn it over to Dan, if he wants to touch on pipeline
Sure
So, we intentionally wanted to make sure we didn't have any surprises here because we do have a little bit of a funky quarterly distribution of our core FFO per share this year
So we did have a little bit of a pull forward of some good news on the revenue and NOI front during the quarter
We had a positive outcome on a property tax accrual
So, we do see a quarter-to-quarter step down, due to some of those good newses not repeating themselves
And the G&A is going to pick up, based on timing of when we did our promotions, merit increases and stock grants
And then we do have a decent portion of our backlog that comes in back half of the year
I think, I'm not sure if that's included in our prepared remarks, we signed our – a lease for the second phase of Osaka, which is – that property is essentially now fully leased and we've also purchased a land parcel for expansion of that campus
Both the first customer and the second customer that will be landing in Osaka are late back half of 2017 revenue event
So they'll be coming on in the fourth quarter and providing some growth going into 2018.
Maybe I'll just highlight some of the components that got us to north of $50 million signings this quarter, which I do think lend itself to additional strong quarters in 2017. Although I – we can't promise and I can't promise north of $50 million every quarter of 2017. I mean, you're 100% right
One way to generate incremental revenue is to do that in incremental footprint
And I think you saw that in a few pockets of our portfolio in the first quarter
I already talked about our wins in Osaka
If you hop over to Europe for a second, I can tell you that we had a fairly large signing within a new customer to Digital in Dublin
We had a similar – existing digital customer that anchor our scale campus deployment in Amsterdam
We also had some wins on the colocation front
So we had expansion in both U.S
and Europe in terms of colocation signing wins
And I can tell you, Frankfurt is coming online, from a campus perspective, at the back half of 2017. We haven't signed any major leases there to date, but we have had smaller wins in Frankfurt, including a digital – long time digital relationship, a colocation customer that was seeking colocation footprint
We are able to place them into one of those eight assets we acquired last summer with a 250-kilowatt or 240-kilowatt colocation footprint
But they came to us, not just because of that, seeking that deployment, but also our relationship and the fact that they could see the growth into our campus down the road in the future
So lots of positive momentum
New places to sell that could lend itself to continued steady-eddy growth in our signings
And that's obviously what we're seeking
And I don't know if anyone else wants to chime in here on that front
If you're able to kind of exceed our internal lease expectations and kind of hit the right-hand side of that guidance table on, call it, page 5 or 6 of our financial supplement, I mean, we see tremendous flow through and you see that by the fact of our operating margins at the property level or EBITDA level
So those will certainly be indicators that pushes through the higher end, if not, above the higher end of the guidance
But again, it's only – we got three quarter – three months, one quarter done, so we got a long way to go still
Paul, we try to stick with the precedents, and the precedent here has been to give annual guidance and not provide the quarterly granularity
And we certainly help to work with modeling questions off-line, if anyone would like to discuss
We just – given that a little bit of a pickup in G&A, pick up in G&A was like roughly around 6% of our revenue
So, obviously trending towards the low-end of our guidance range
That's going to be a little bit of a haircut
And we also have some capital stack items, which have been not there
The last leg of our forward equity offering will close out in that 2.4 million shares to our share count
So those items, in particular, are obviously going to create a little bit of a step down from the first quarter to the second quarter for core FFO per share
But we see that being offset with additional revenue from our properties in the back half of the year
So we sunsetted that slide with kind of the year one completion of our underwriting and meeting and exceeding them on all of our financial objectives
Broadly speaking, integration from the Telx transaction is really down to a limited amount of items
The teams fully are integrated
That unification of the sales and marketing team under Dan's leadership was the final piece of that
We do have to sunset the Telx accounting system, which we'll complete later this year
But from a people, process and systems standpoint, we're almost really close to the finish line, if not there
In terms of financials, that's really been a part of our success in, on – in the North America colocation and interconnection business
You've seen that's had a – we've had a tick up in our signings volume, you've seen a tick-up in our interconnection revenue line item, be it quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year
We've grown the North America colocation footprint
I believe the total colo footprint is now about a 17% expansion relative to prior to when we bought the Telx business
So we've grown them in Ashburn, and had some wins with new customer there
We've grown them in the Richardson Campus
We've expanded their footprint in 350 East (44:58) Cermak and we're also seeing some strong demand in our 600 West 7th asset in LA
So off to a start, (45:08) pretty much through the chute on integration and continue to track along and be a key contributor of our business despite the slide not being in the deck anymore
Hey Rob, this is Andy again and congratulations on your new post
Well-deserved
So you were asking colocation signings volumes quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year?
It's a piece of the colo numbers, obviously, Europe, the addition of the eight assets in Europe
But you can see in our table, the signing numbers are broken out
So they're – and you still do see a step-up in North America volumes
I think our colo interconnection signings were our highest signings numbers since we acquired the Telx business, a little – about two years ago almost
And I think in the history of Telx, it's a top two, yes, top two performance
I think we saw, not only continuation of traditional customers growing their footprint or connectivity packages but we saw a lot of new wins, be it new customers to the colocation footprint or an existing customer going to a new market, both of which not only spur – that case type not only spurs demand for space and power but incremental connectivity
So I think those are some of the elements that kind of drove the results
I'm not – I think coming together as one unified team under Dan's leadership certainly played a part in it
But I think having more time with the full multi-product offering across the globe certainly helps us as well
Same page here
Sure, Matt
I'll start and I'll let the other guys chime in here
So broadly speaking, I mean, I'll speak to more scale orientation, that's the bigger volumes side in terms of size of deals
The Ashburn continues to be a very robust and diverse customer backdrop
We continue to see numerous signings, fairly sizable signings
Obviously, Ashburn, there is also a competitive set
We think we're winning our fair share, or if not more
And we still see demand being very large and growing and eclipsing that supply in that market
After Ashburn, you kind of go to Dallas and Chicago in terms of overall size of markets
Similar number – similar dynamics, I'd say to an Ashburn but probably just a little bit smaller in terms of markets, smaller in terms of number of customers, smaller in terms of some of the size of the deals in some scenarios
And if you head west to Silicon Valley, that's probably our tightest market by far, a much more limited supply
I can tell you that based on the demand outpacing supply in that market, we've seen an uptick in face rates of deals signed, we signed, I'd call it, two deals kind of 0.5 megawatt each
So kind of small scale or large colo deals at, call it 150-ish or north rates per kilowatt in this past quarter
And I know those rates going back several quarters or a year or could've been in the 130s-ish kind of area
So you've seen a little bit of pick up and that's the one market where large deals seem to be picking up based on supply and demand dynamics
Europe, as a whole, it's – we have a smaller presence there relative to our U.S
business
Those major markets are not quite at the same size as an Ashburn, Virginia
But I'd still say that we had good progress in London, especially if you look in the kind of last, call it, six to nine months, all post Brexit
I believe we had quote (54:35) $16 million of signings or so during that time period
We've kind of really filled out our existing scale campuses and moving on to expansion in Crawley, and we had some good progress in Dublin and Amsterdam as well as in the scale leasing side as well
I'm not sure there's a favorite although I certainly like the attributes of Silicon Valley when rates pick up like that
That's incremental profit to the bottom line by controlling supply in that market that's very limited
But we're seeing – if you've seen our sup, our returns are little bit higher in North America than Europe and then followed by Asia
Asia is way down a little bit based on the fact that Osaka, where we went in there with a little bit of an anchor de-risking market entry, signed two fairly large anchor deals to round out that initial campus
And also you have the fact that overall returns in Japan are a little bit lower
But I'm not sure I have a favorite
I'll let the other guys chime in – any other commentary?
Sure
Maybe, Colby, I'll speak to Dallas first
So I can tell you that we've had – I know we had some decently sized wins in the Dallas market last quarter, in the fourth quarter, one with a partner that landed a healthcare company on our campus and then this quarter, we had a digital economy name with a decent kind of meg-plus deal landed on the Richardson Campus as well
And I know we have a – and that market specifically kind of has some attractive opportunities that we're working on right now with some of our largest customers looking to grow their footprint
I think, obviously, we're not alone in Dallas and we're competing with RagingWire and others
I think, those are the types of markets where you have to really differentiate yourself and bring more to the table of the customer, be it multiple U.S
markets, multiple geographic regions, a public company, investor-grade track record and 10-plus years of operating excellence
So there's a lot of things we do to differentiate our value prop with each customers and to have – and differentiate our relationships with the customers to win over some of them, may be in one or two markets, be it just in the U.S
In terms of the flow through, yes, we are quite pleased with the sign to commence creeping down to just under three months
I think you nailed the reasons in your own question, actually
We do have a range in the revenue line item
We do have some churn, which I highlighted but I would call churn with a silver lining because it's opportunities to, where we can reposition space and make incremental or are making incremental returns on that space and that's, I would say, that's part of the reason that we went with a $0.05 increase to the bottom end of our guidance and kept the top end constant
Hey, Richard, it's really all predicated on our success here
So we've taken an approach to incrementally grow our colocation footprint what we thought it made sense, be it in our Internet gateways, where we already had a dominant presence right in the (01:01:16) room, had a connectivity and ecosystems stronghold and could build out incremental pods for – to sell colo into all new places, where you put the flags, be it in Ashburn or Richardson and Franklin Park is probably the next stop on the North America campus and Dublin is probably the next stop on the European campus
And I know Singapore is probably the next step on the Asia campus
But we're doing it very incrementally, call it 0.5 meg to 1 meg increments
We're not going to build a 5-megawatt, 10-megawatt colo all, and just waiting to fill it up over a longer time period
And the other thing I'd say, you have working against in the pie chart is that we do have – I mean, we're still doing pretty strong larger footprint scale wins
Scale was 61% of total signings during the quarter
And we have – that part of the pie is growing at the same time
So I wish I could tell it's going to be exactly this but we're trying to make sure we have the offering for the full product suite, the cage or (01:02:17) cabinet up to the multiple megawatts halls
And depending where demand and customers grow, that's going to (01:02:23) get bucketed between a colocation or a scale customer suite
Two trends, I would say, bigger the deployment, longer the term
If a customer wants to do a massive deployment, with us at least, they want to go 10, 15 years and we – that's something we appreciate and we want them to go 10, 15 years given the concentration risk of when that one expiration comes due
So anything kind of call it, 5, 10 years or north, we're trying to push for longer and the customer usually is also pushing for longer customarily
Secondly, you'll see our Powered Base Building renewals, that's – those are – just to remind you, those are places where we own a highly improved shell and the customers put on their own dollar the full build-out of the last, call it, 70% to 80% of the infrastructure
They've got lots of dollars sunk in the space and you can see those renewals when they do come through, they have customers contracting for a longer time period than a fully built out suite
