Thanks, Sujal and thank you, everyone, for joining us today
I'm very excited to share our strong results for the third quarter and our increased growth and earnings outlook we're providing for the full year
I believe this quarter's performance continues to demonstrate the strength of our business model with all of our segments contributing
It also reflects the ongoing effective implementation of our strategy to create safer, sustainable, productive and connected solutions for our customers
To briefly recap the key elements of our strategy that we've been driving, number one it's about driving above market growth through our focus on harsh environment applications, where we can accelerate content growth
Secondly, it's about leveraging our TEOA continuous improvement system to expand our margin
And lastly, it's delivery and consistent execution of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which allows us to further strengthen our position in our markets via bolt-on M&A, while also returning capital back to our owners
When you look at our third quarter, we delivered sales of $3.4 billion
This represents 8% organic growth year-over-year with growth across all our segments, as well as regions
We delivered 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.24, which is up 15% over the prior year
This year's growth in EPS year-over-year was entirely driven by our sales and operating income performance
If you want to look at our $1.24 compared to our guidance of $1.16 approximately half was driven by the higher sales growth of 8% with the remainder driven by taxes and a little bit of currency
As a result of our momentum and what we're seeing in our markets in orders, we are raising the mid-point of our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance to $12.9 billion and $4.73 in EPS
This represents 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted EPS growth versus the prior year
With this, we firmly believe that TE is firing on all cylinders with all segments contributing to both revenue growth and margin expansion this year
As I think about this year and to put it in perspective, back when we gave guidance in November, we assumed 3% organic growth and $4.34 adjusted earnings per share compared to the $3.95 we did in 2016 on a 52-week basis
The increase since the start of the year reflects strong organic growth across all segments and operational improvements across our businesses that now results in the 7% organic growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth, driven almost entirely by our strong operational performance
The broad-based growth ahead of the markets we serve continues to reinforce our strategic progress on content growth and having the right products to the right markets
If you look at our new guidance for the year compared to last quarter, the 7% organic growth outlook is an improvement of 100 basis points, and we're raising our earnings per share guidance by $0.11. I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 3 and let me review some of additional highlights from the third quarter
Not only do we have growth across all segments and regions, but each of our segments delivered growth ahead of our expectations in the quarter
We delivered 8% organic growth in Transportation, with growth across automotive, commercial transportation and sensors
In Industrial Solutions, organic growth of 5% was driven by strength in factory automation and medical applications
And in the Communications Solutions segment, sales increased 14% organically with growth across each of our three business units, demonstrating the progress we have made in transforming this segment to be a contributor to overall TE performance
Also during the quarter, we had strong free cash flow of over $400 million that we generated, and we returned $324 million back to our owners, and we also announced bolt-on acquisitions in the automotive and medical markets that will expand our portfolio and ability to provide integrated highly engineered solutions in these growing markets
Let me get into the order trends
I appreciate if you could turn to slide 4. We continue to see broad based strength in orders across our segments as well as balanced order growth across regions which reinforces expectations for a higher growth versus our prior view
Total orders which exclude SubCom were $3.3 billion during the quarter, and this is up 12% year-over-year on both a reported and an organic basis
Organically excluding SubCom, our orders grew evenly with the Americas, Asia and Europe each growing low double digits in the quarter
And if you reflect back at the start of the year when we guided in our first quarter, orders and revenue growth were heavily weighted towards Asia and were encouraged by the balance we are now seeing as Europe and United States continue to strengthen
In Transportation, orders increased 15% organically with growth in all regions and particular strength in Europe and Asia
Industrial orders grew 6% organically year-over-year, with growth in all regions and particular strength in Asia
And in Communications excluding SubCom, we saw year-over-year organic order growth of 12%, including 7% growth in data and devices from high-speed connectivity ramping in cloud and data center applications, while appliance orders grew 17% year-over-year
One thing I'd like to highlight that while on a year-over-year basis, orders increased double digits in the third quarter, the guidance that we gave for the fourth quarter reflects mid-single-digit revenue growth
In our customers broader supply chain, there are supply constraints in certain areas that led to some of our quarter's reorders (8:47) being placed for delivery outside of our fourth quarter, and we have accounted for this dynamic in our guidance for the fourth quarter
So let me turn to segment performance, and let me start with Transportation, if you could turn to slide 5, please
The third quarter was another very strong quarter for our Transportation segment, which continued to show our content growth momentum
Sales grew 8% organically year-over-year, and operating margins were in line with our expectations
Segment sales exceeded expectations due to strong auto demand across regions and our leading position in the heavy truck market, along with strong sensors growth which was 7% organically
In auto, our sales were up 6% organically with mid-single-digit growth rate in the Americas, Europe and Asia against a global auto production growth of only 1%
We continue to consistently demonstrate the ability to outperform the market due to content growth and expect that trend to continue even at these lower production levels
We also expect the benefit from new program ramps as we go forward which will also continue the outperformance due to content versus market
For the full year of 2017, we expect high-single-digit organic growth in auto on approximately 3% production growth, but clearly that 3% production growth was driven by the stronger production growth in the first half that we talked about in prior calls
Turning to commercial transportation, our business continues to outperform the market with organic revenue growth of 23% year-over-year
Growth is driven by continued strength in the global heavy-duty truck market, particularly in China, and while we do expect China growth will moderate over time, we are encouraged to see signs of continued growth in Europe and North America as these markets improve
In sensors, during the quarter, our business grew 7% organically year-over-year with growth driven by Transportation as well as an improving industrial backdrop, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year in our sensors business
Additionally, we're also encouraged by the strong design win momentum that we had in sensors that was reflected by double-digit order growth year-over-year in the quarter
Adjusted operating margin were as expected at approximately 19% in the quarter in the segment, but I would say, at these year-over-year revenue growth levels, we would normally expect a corresponding expansion of margins versus where we guided
However, demand in the second half of this year has exceeded our expectations, and has led to some near-term inefficiencies in our supply chain as we make sure we satisfy our customers
This is a temporary issue as our teams are fully engaged to ensure our customers are not impacted by these supply dynamics, and we expect this to be fully remedied in early fiscal 2018. So let's talk about the Industrial Solutions segment, so I'd appreciate if you could turn to slide 6. Growth momentum in the Industrial Solutions segment continued with 5% organic growth year-over-year in the quarter
Segment sales did exceed our expectations due to strength in industrial equipment with this business growing 10% organically
Now, this growth we saw in the industrial equipment side is really due to our position in the factory automation and medical markets, also coupled with the acquisitions that we completed last year, and this is really driving the strong growth ahead of the market on both a reported and on an organic basis
When you think about Intercontec and Creganna, both of these acquisitions performing exceptionally well and ahead of our expectations
In aerospace, defense and marine, we did see a slight organic decline in the quarter in revenue, and this was driven entirely by program timing in commercial aerospace, and that was partially offset by growth in defense
Our energy business in the quarter grew 2% organically, and that was driven by growth in Europe and Asia
On the margin side, our adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 12.7%, and this was flat sequentially and down year-over-year due to the near term softness in commercial aerospace, which does run above segment average margins
We do expect Industrial segment margins to resume expansion in our fourth quarter, and this will be both on a sequential and year-over-year basis, driven by a combination of both growth and cost actions
Adjusted EBITDA for the segment were steady year-over-year at 17%
So if you could please turn to page 7, and let me cover Communications
The Communications segment delivered another outstanding quarter with 14% organic growth and 500 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 16%
Performance was well ahead of the market and included contributions from all three of the businesses
Starting with data and devices
Data and devices had 6% organic growth as we continued to benefit from high-speed ramps in cloud infrastructure customers
In addition, because of our multiyear transformation, our D&D business more than doubled its adjusted operating margin from a year ago, driving significant improvement at the segment level as the actions that we took to focus the portfolio and optimize our operations are essentially complete
In appliances, we had another solid quarter with 14% organic growth year-over-year as demand remained strong particularly in Asia
And in SubCom, growth was 22% organically in the quarter reflecting the strong growth cycle of this business
Earlier this month, we announced the winning of a new regional program which provides high-speed bandwidth between the Caribbean and the United States, and we continue to expect high-single-digit growth for the SubCom business in 2017. Now, with that as a backdrop, I'll hand it over to Heath who'll get into the financials in more detail
And let me get into guidance, and I'll start with the fourth quarter
And if you could turn to slide 10, please, I'd appreciate it
For the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter revenue at $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 to $1.16. When you look at this, this represents reported sales growth of 5% and organic sales growth of 4%
And from an operational perspective, this would be adjusted EPS growth of 8% once you normalize with the unusually low tax rate we had last year that Heath just highlighted
Looking at it by segment
For the fourth quarter, we expect Transportation Solutions to grow mid single digits on both a reported and on an organic basis
This is above expected auto production levels of 1% with the outperformance driven by the content growth I mentioned earlier
We also expect growth in commercial transportation across all regions in the fourth quarter, and as noted earlier, we do expect to have some lingering effects on margins from supply chain dynamics in the fourth quarter
But expect margin performance to improve as we put these issues behind us in early 2018. In Industrial Solutions, we expect to grow high single digits on a reported basis and mid-single digits organically, with growth expected across all three of our business units
And we also expect, as I mentioned, operating margins to expand sequentially as well as year-over-year in the fourth quarter
And in Communications, we expect also mid-single-digit growth on both the reported and organic basis with growth in each of our three businesses
And while we're not providing guidance beyond this fiscal year, I would ask that as you look at your models, you keep in mind our typical seasonal trends as you think about next year
And while demand continues to be strong, we historically see seasonal declines in the mid-single-digit range from quarter four into our first quarter
I'd also ask as you think about adjusted operating margins, please keep in mind that we're currently running in the mid-16% range, and that the first quarter 2017 had an unusually high operating margin level that we covered in detail back in the first quarter call
Now, let's turn to slide 11, so I can cover full guidance or ramp up and then go to Q&A
We are raising the midpoint of our guidance to represent 7% organic revenue growth and 20% adjusted earnings per share growth for 2017. We expect revenue in the range of $12.85 billion to $12.95 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $4.72 to $4.74. I'm very proud that our 20% EPS growth is driven almost entirely by strong organic growth performance and operating income expansion that we have in 2017. We did also benefit from using our strong cash flow model both via adding on bolt-on M&A and returning capital to our owners
When you think about the growth in the margin and the EPS by segment, we expect Transportation Solutions to be up high-single digits organically on approximately 3% global auto production growth this year, reflecting continued content growth and share gains
Commercial transportation, we'd expect it to outperform its end market benefiting from both content expansion and share gain in heavy trucks, and we continue to expect sensors to grow mid-single digits year-over-year, as I previously mentioned
In Industrial Solutions for the year, organic growth guidance of low-single digits is consistent with the guidance we've been giving since the start of the year, reflecting continued improvement in industrial markets
And in Communications, we expect it to be up high-single digits organically, a further improvement versus our prior view, reflecting continued strength in our appliances and growth in data and devices
Our guidance relating to SubCom is being maintained that we're going to grow high-single digits in that business
In summary, I feel very good about our portfolio and execution and believe we are well-positioned to deliver growth ahead of our markets
As Heath mentioned, we've established levers to drive earnings growth and continue to perform well against our business model, and this year's results represent best-in-class performance with 7% organic growth, expanded operating margins and 20% adjusted EPS growth that these results truly demonstrate the execution along all the levers we have in our business model
Lastly, before I go to Q&A, I want to close by thanking our employees all around the world for their continued strong execution and commitment to our customers
So, with that, Sujal, let's open it up for questions
Thank you, Wamsi, for the question
But let me take it because it is something what we think about our Transportation business model, first it always starts with a global picture
And I think one of the things that we're very fortunate about where we drive growth it's just not in one region in the world it's across the world
And even as production has slowed down to 1% and pretty much in line with where we are, it does come back to how do we drive across the three big trends that are happening in the vehicle
And we've continuously shown content growth, and it has been accelerating both from our focus as you think about not only what's happening in the connected car or in safety applications, but also benefiting from everything that happens around the powertrain whether it's on combustion engine that needs to get more fuel efficient towards the adoption of electric vehicles that while we talk electric vehicles and you really think about it, we get very excited around where electric vehicles are going in China
So it is along all three dimensions both with where safety applications go, certainly the emission and the green go and also around the connected
And what we feel very proud of if you went back five years ago, our content per vehicle in a car was around $50. Today, it's well over $60, and we with the programs that we are winning, we see that content momentum continuing to increase
And when you take the results that we have in a 1% production environment, like we've had in quarter three as well as what we expect really in quarter four, growing mid-single-digit shows the content momentum we have
And I just think we continue to demonstrate it and we feel very good about the program ramps will continue to allow us to have that type of separation even as global production stays at a low-single-digit to flat environment that we're in
Thank you, Wamsi
Yeah
So let me talk about EV
And I always do think, Shawn, it's important to make sure when you talk EV about – close to 90 million cars are made in the world, and today, there's about 4 million that are electric vehicles whether it's pure electric or plug-in hybrid, et cetera
So, what's really – what we like about that is you do have your emission regulation to drive that increase, but when you sit there, we see the opportunity to that type of level to quadruple of the amount of electric type vehicles over the next five years
And when you see that, clearly, that creates higher demand for power and voltage connections that also gets into things we do from our very high-current relay-type products, as well as you get into sensing that occurs there
And when you sit there, that really comes down to the energy management that gets into the harsh environment
So the whole environment that you have there really plays to our strength of our engineers and how we have to work with our customers to really make this volume grow
When you think about from a content, on a traditional combustion engine, due to the trends I just talked about, what occurs on that combustion on a model, we typically get about 1.5 multiple of content to a hybrid and then about 2x content increase on a pure electric
So if something has $60 today of content on a vehicle, an opportunity to get closer to $100 on a hybrid and you could go up to basically $120 on a full electric is the simplest way to think about it
So that's the excitement we have around the content growth, and that comes into the emissions
So we think we're very well-positioned, we think we're positioned globally in all regions of the world around the players in that market and it is part of our content growth story of how we position ourselves and it's investments we've been making
I would guess it's a fair question, but really what it is, is what we're seeing is in certain parts of the supply chain, you see this in some areas and so forth as lead times have expanded, we've seen some customer behavior place orders now that are a little bit more extended
So when we typically think about our orders, our orders are typically pretty current
We typically have orders that are for the current quarter or further out
We've seen some extended placement out, it is not that we're under shipping demand it's just that I would say people are making sure their supply chains are lined up for as they are doing production because they've been surprised in certain categories
So it's why when we look at our double-digit order growth, our guidance is more mid-single digit growth in the fourth quarter because we see orders placed out to the far first fiscal quarter and into second fiscal quarter
I don't see them being cancelled
I just think there will be things that will smooth out over time
I would say when you take our lead times, collectively, yes, they're pretty normal
There are some pockets, like Heath talked about on his automotive question, as well as some of our businesses where you see 14% and 20% growth
They've extended a certain product category, but it's very pocketed, not broad based
I think it's pretty pure actually, Amit
So when you sit there, I think it's pretty pure
Things getting extended, I would not say
The automotive supply chain stays pretty tight, and that's why we have some of the extra cost to make sure we do not disappoint our customers
But in auto itself, I would say, when you look at the growth we've had, it doesn't pull in meaningfully or push out meaningfully because that's why we've had the extra cost
Sure, Craig
Let me take that, and I think when you think about North America automotive, I want to take a step back and frame global automotive first
We have to realize there's 90 million cars, plus or minus, made on the planet and 17 million of those cars are made in the United States
So I do think we have to remember, 50 million of the cars made in the planet are in Asia, and well in the mid-20s are made in Europe
So North America while we live in every day as Americans, it is the minor part of production when you think about it globally
Our automotive business in North America, and we look at this year, like I said, we have about mid-single-digit growth here in the quarter
So we have the same content trends but the size or sensitivity is only about $800 million of total TE
So, it's only about 6%
And even as you said North America automotive production went down 5%, and we decline with it, it would be $40 million of revenue and a couple of pennies
So, I think about it, I think it gets a little bit too much press when you think about TE versus our great global position we have in automotive
And if we correct it by 5% production, it will be couple of cents in the big picture
So, certainly we won't want to see that, but it won't be a big thing in the big picture of TE
On sensors, your second question, when we sit there our turf momentum that we talked to you about in many quarters is continuing
And what we really appreciate is that the programs that we're winning across the sensor portfolio that we got with mesh (39:40) the wins we're getting with our customers are across humidity, pressure, force, position, et cetera
So what's really great is across the whole product set, which is what we were excited about, and it's also across all regions of the world
It's not concentrated
So I think it does show the momentum that we really have strength in the automotive with our great sales team and go-to market resources
From the momentum, it hasn't really changed
We are industrializing some of the programs
We expect to have revenue in the second half 2018. As we have we'll continue updating you on it, but it continues like we talked about last quarter and previously
So really good momentum
Hey, Joe
Thanks for the question
It's Terrence
And great question
I think when you think about SubCom, you're right on
When you think about the customer dynamics versus where they were 5 to 10 years ago, it's clearly a customer dynamic that you actually have the real user relay to the business model doing it
So that's always a plus and I feel very good how our team been executing organic wins with those important customers
When you think about it, this year we're going to be a little bit below $1 billion, and I think as you look into next year, I think our fair assumption is sort of keep that flattish because we do get to a level of capacity constraints as well as have orders that are coming in and the routes we're building
I think as we sit there, some of the things that we continue to think through is what are the next routes to those customer needs, how do we schedule that
So, it does not feel to us that you would have the trough cycle we've had in the past when you had customer dry up or customers be impacted by financing cycle because these customers do have capital and do not need capital markets
So we're still in the middle of what trough is, but it still feels like a business that the trough is much higher
I think it begun probably in the $700 million to $1 billion range, is what we've been telling people, but I would say we're still trying to figure that out
Matt, you're exactly right
So, let me take it from what we're seeing through our channel partners because when you go outside of Transportation and you're into our Communications segment excluding SubCom as well as our Industrial segment, you do have about 40%, 50% of those businesses go through distribution
So I think that's the right way
It's just the latter part is how you asked it
What we're seeing, we're seeing right now through our channel partners, they're having point-of-sale out that's pretty much high-single digit and their inventory has been very flat
So we don't see inventory building up in the channel and staying very consistent with where it's been
So, we don't see creep up there
And the order rates that we're having from our channel partners were pretty similar to our company average in a low-double digit
So, the dynamics we're seeing through distribution, I would say, are consistent overall
We're not seeing inventory getting ahead of itself
And I would just say when we look at those markets from a direct customer where we service the larger customers direct, it does feel like it's demand
I mean, we're seeing improving markets globally, and what we're seeing and how we're seeing it is these are due to production increases by our customers where we deal with customers directly and not through our channel partners
We'll guide, Matt, when we get to our first quarter call
So, I just think some observations I would make as we exit there
I talked about, certainly, I think with what we're seeing, we would expect a seasonal coming out of the quarter four and the quarter one
I think when you take the bigger picture, and I think about next year, number one is the content growth story we have in automotive, I think, is very evident of the traction we have
And I think it's fair to assume that automotives, being in this flat to plus 1% production environment where we are right now, would continue into next year
And I think we've been very clear that we think we can grow mid-single digit in it
I think when you get into the industrial markets, I see them improving
So I think sort of where we're running right now, our strength in the medical market certainly what we're seeing along factory automation applications which is real demand when we see it with the servos, the drives, the robotics
We're seeing that and we're winning in those applications
And certainly, medical
We talked about being a mid to high single digit grower
And the Communications area
I think SubCom, back to Joe's question, I think I would think about that being flat next year
And then in D&D and appliances, I think you would have things that would be closer to where those markets are, after a really hot year
So I think that's the way I would probably think about the growth going into next year just sitting here today
And we'll give you our formal guidance when we talk to you in November
But that's just, as you all think about it maybe some ways to frame it, based upon what we're seeing here without formally guiding
Thanks Jim
Jim, when you look at – it's Terrence, I think there is two pieces to it
The biggest piece is the efforts we've done over the last three years to get that business focused on high speed and move away from the consumer device base primarily
So when you look at the big growth, it's really the culmination of the cost actions as well as the focus of the portfolio that we did in that segment mainly around D&D
Secondarily, we also did get benefit
SubCom had a very strong organic growth of 22%
So that's also contributing to the increase
I think longer term you should think about the segment margins staying around mid teens, depending upon where the businesses are, but that's where I think you can think about it, but a lot of that margin improvement was structural impact that we've been driving over the past three years that we've talked to you all about
No
Well, just to make sure what I said maybe I wasn't clear, when we look at that, it's just our orders have been placed on us because people are worried about the extended supply chain, and we were impacted by that
Our revenue is going to be pretty pure
I don't see anything impacting
I wouldn't say our revenue in the fourth quarter
It's just our orders were higher
On the items that Heath talked about, maybe around Transportation, it's not related to passives
This would be base metals, some plastics, things that we actually use on our manufacturing that because our demand was higher, certainly a good problem to have, and it has created inefficiencies not only in the extended supply chain, but also bringing in our factories, we had to do more changeovers to make sure we didn't disappoint our customers, which we're always going to do
So, hopefully that clarifies it
Yeah
China auto as we spoke early in the year was extremely strong back in that first quarter as the incentives were benefiting, and you saw it in the registrations
You saw it in their production
What's been nice is, China auto is sort of have played out as we expected
It was a little stronger in the first half, but as it worked down post the incentive, it's been in line with what we have expected
And the other thing that's very nice to your point, you're starting to see registrations turn positive, and what we've also seen is that dealer inventories are back to normal levels in China around – we typically like to see them around 40 days and that's where they're at
So it doesn't feel like there's a hangover of where production is
And so, when we look forward, clearly, we'll have a compare that we'll have to deal with them in the first quarter, but we see the content story being very strong, and I think China will continue to have production growth
So, very positive on it and it's actually nice that it's come in line with how we expected
Okay
Hi, Sherri
Thank you for the question
First on Subsea and then I'll let Heath do taxes
On Subsea, I think when you look at it, when we talk about it historically, it would be – it has a benefit in an up cycle SubCom and if you went down the trough, how you look at it
It is a very strong business model from an ROIC no matter where you are
I do think it would be slightly dilutive to the Communication margins in the lower part of the cycle, but clearly not as dilutive if you were much lower like it has been in other parts of the cycle
So, I think you can think about it a little bit more linearly
Clearly, and always margin comes into which are the projects we have going, which projects we want, but I think when you think of it from a volume basis, clearly it won't be as dilutive as it was before
And Heath, I'll let you talk about taxes
Thanks, Sherri
