Thank you, Stefan, and good morning, everyone
Before I review our performance and future outlook, I want to reiterate that our foundation is strong
As Stefan said, we worked very closely since I joined, and we will continue that partnership through his extended transition period to ensure that our progress is uninterrupted
With the support of Ralph, the Board and together with our leadership team, I am committed to leading our continued execution
We are as focused as we have ever been on delivering the Way Forward Plan to strengthen the brand and drive sustainable profitable growth over the long term
Now on to our performance, first let’s review the progress we made this quarter in executing the Way Forward Plan, starting with product for fall 2017. First, we refocused and evolved our iconic core product offering
We updated our color palette, materials, and fits, incorporating more consumer insights and marketplace intelligence into our decision making
Second, we improved our discipline in applying a systematic repeatable way of building a stronger assortment
This means being very clear on what we are testing, what we are growing and what icons we are reinventing
This has enabled us to cut the long tail of unproductive styles delivering a double digit reduction in the number of SKUs we have designed for fall 2017, resulting in a much more focused, productive assortment and lower development costs
Third, our improved disciplined in the assortment creation is enabling us to buy closer to market and reduce early commitments
Our premarket commitments for next fall is down significantly to last year
For Polo, we committed to only 15% of our buys premarket, before our wholesale customers place their orders
Last year, this figure was 60%
As a result we are buying much more informed which will significantly improve our ability to match inventory to demand
The initial feedback from our wholesale customers that have seen our fall product has been very positive
Fourth, we are well underway to build a best-in-class sourcing capability and a demand driven supply chain
We remained on track to reach our goal of a nine month lead time
We continue to expect to get half way there by the end of this fiscal year and 90% there by the end of next fiscal year
This quarter we achieved our goal of having all our core fabrics platformed for the upcoming fall 2017 season, which enables us to make further progress in cutting our lead times
Moving on to marketing, we are making good progress in our search for a Chief Marketing Officer
In the meantime we are preparing for our first cut through Polo marketing campaign for summer
For this past fall holiday season we launched the Ralph Lauren Icon Marketing campaign, which was built on our goal to refocus on and evolve our core iconic products and luxury
The campaign was very well received and we will be launching the second part of the campaign later this month
Moving on to our financials for the quarter, we continued to deliver against our commitments
We increased our quality of sales by moderating discount levels, lowering our inventory to align supply with demand and reducing our lead times
As you saw in our press release revenues declined 12%, in line with guidance
Adjusted operating margin was 12.8%
On a constant currency basis adjusted operating margin was up about 40 basis points to last year
Additionally non-GAAP operating margin expanded in constant currency, in both the retail and wholesale segments
The adjusted operating margin performance was better than the outlook we provided in November, largely driven by gross margin and proactive expense management
Adjusted gross margin expanded by a 140 basis points, versus last year driven by favorable geographic and channel mix and initiatives to improve quality of sale including reduced promotional activity across our businesses
This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects of approximately a 100 basis points
Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and other related charges were down 7% compared to last year, as a result of expense initiatives under the Way Forward Plan, including streamlining the organization to reduce headcount, process changes and product development to reduce costs and closing unprofitable stores to improve the profitability of our fleet
In North America, across our businesses the team started to execute against the plan we shared last quarter to come back to high performance
North America continues to be our most challenged market
Revenue declined 15% in the quarter led by a plan decline in wholesale
We strengthened our foundation by strategically reducing shipments to better align with underlying demand and right size our inventory levels
In addition we started to rebalance our distribution in our off-price wholesale business
We also executed these important quality of sale initiatives in our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business
These actions will continue to impact our results in the fourth quarter on our e-commerce site
E-commerce has been our most over promoted channel and we are moving to harmonize pricing across channel and reduce promotion depth
These are the first steps in the execution of our plan to come back to high performance in North America
They are difficult but necessary actions to build a healthy base to grow from
We expect these actions to continue through the first half of fiscal 2018. In Europe store comps improved in the third quarter despite lower markdowns as we continued to deliver on our quality of sales initiative
Our Europe team continued to drive substantial improvement in both gross margin and operating margin in constant currency
Revenue was down 6% in constant currency and 12% on a reported basis
As expected we shifted $18 million of wholesale shipments to the fourth quarter to better align with demand in our wholesale doors
Excluding this shift revenue would have been close to flat in constant currency
In our retail business in Europe we reduced promotion, drove up AURs and expanded gross margins significantly on a year-over-year basis in constant currency
Our team continues to focus on tighter inventory management and strengthening the assortment going forward
Similarly in Asia, we drove significantly lower markdown rates in each channel and expanded margins
Revenue was down 1% in constant currency and up 4% on a reported basis
Comp growth was positive in Asia in the third quarter
Going forward, we are focused on returning to revenue growth in Asia, as new distribution growth offsets closures
Moving to comparable store sales, on a global basis, comps decreased 4% in constant currency
As a reminder the high volume week after Christmas was included in the company’s third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter last year, with a positive impact of approximately 2.5 percentage points, which will pressure comps in the fourth quarter
Additionally, Easter will shift into the first quarter of FY 2018. The combined effect of these two calendar shifts will pressure fourth quarter comps approximately 3 percentage points
Moving to global e-commerce, revenues declined 9% in constant currency, the e-commerce decline is driven by our initiatives in the U.S
that I just took you through
The impact of these actions will accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue to pressure the first half of fiscal 2018. Turning to our store fleet, we are on track to close approximately 50 stores this year
We closed 12 stores in the third quarter and 27 year-to-date
This puts us on track to achieve the savings that we identified from store closures of approximately $70 million
Importantly, we are also on track with our total savings target
At this time restructuring charges are forecasted to be about $400 million and inventory charges about a $150 million associated with the company’s Way Forward Plan
In this quarter, we recorded $91 million in restructuring related impairment and inventory charges
Moving on to the balance sheet, our progress with the Way Forward Plan is reflected in our inventory position
At the end of the third quarter, inventory declined 23% to $984 million versus last year
This inventory reduction is driven by both, restructuring actions and our operating process initiatives, including a proactive pull back in receipts and moving towards a demand driven supply chain
We ended the third quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash in investments and $589 million of total debt
Now I’d like to turn to guidance for fiscal 2017. As a reminder this guidance excludes restructuring and other related charges in connection with the company’s Way Forward Plan and severance-related payments associated with the CEO departure announced today
For fiscal 2017, we are maintaining our guidance
We continue to expect revenues to decrease at a low double digit rate, as we execute the Way Forward Plan
Based on our current exchange rates foreign currency is expected to have minimal impact on revenue growth in fiscal 2017. We also continue to expect operating margin for fiscal 2017, to be approximately 10%, as cost savings are expected to be offset by growth in new store expenses, unfavorable foreign currency impacts, infrastructure investments and fixed costs deleverage
The fiscal 2017 tax rate is estimated to be approximately 29%
For the fourth quarter, we expect revenues to be down mid-teens on a reported basis
This compares 13 weeks this year to 14 weeks last year
The 53rd week last year, contributed approximately $72 million of net revenue including $10 million in the wholesale segment and $62 million in the retail segment, as well as $12 million of operating income
Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is expected to pressure revenue growth by about a 100 basis points in the fourth quarter and will pressure gross margin by approximately 70 basis points
Operating margin for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 6% to 6.5%
Foreign currency is estimated to pressure operating margin by about a 100 basis points
The fourth quarter tax rate is estimated at 30%
We now expect capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 to be approximately $325 million, down $50 million from our previous guidance of $375 million and we increased our rigor and focus on return on investment
Regarding share repurchases year-to-date we have repurchased a $100 million of our stock and we plan to execute another $100 million in the fourth quarter to reach $200 million for the full year, consistent with our communication in June
Our expectations for fiscal ‘18 are consistent with the outlook we provided at our Investor Day in June
We continue to expect the magnitude of revenue decline to stabilize and be less than the declines in fiscal ‘17. Currently we are forecasting revenue in fiscal ‘18 to decline high single-digits in constant currency
This includes 200 basis points of pressure from our actions in right sizing our distribution in both wholesale and retail and another 200 basis points from the previously announced closure of denim in supply
These actions will be taken in conjunction with our quality of sales and price harmonization initiatives
We expect our trend to improve in the second half of the year as we move forward in the execution of the Way Forward Plan
We expect operating margin to expand in fiscal ‘18 in constant currency, driven by both gross margin and operating cost improvement
We plan to provide more specific guidance for fiscal ‘18 on our fourth quarter call in May as is our practice
In summary, we have created a strong foundation and we are delivering our Way Forward Plan commitments
As I look ahead with the support of Ralph, the Board and together with our leadership team we have the key elements in place to ensure our continued progress
With the passion and commitment of over 25,000 Ralph Lauren employees around the globe we will intensify our execution of the plan, which will strengthen our brand and return us to long term profitable growth
With that I want to turn the call back to Stefan for some closing remarks
Rick, I think we have confidence in the guidance that we laid out in the Way Forward Plan in June, both for 2018 and beyond, in 2019 and 2020. Our commitment is to get to profitable growth
It will be a combination of topline growth and in the near term gross margin expansion and leveraging a better and more efficient cost structure
So we do see gross margin expansion
You’ve seen past several quarters that we've had favorable trend in gross margin
In this quarter, if you look at it around a constant currency basis, we expand a gross margin by 240 basis points
Obviously, we had a 100 points of pressure from foreign currency, but we've got a benefit from about half of the 140 points was the benefit from channel and geographic mix, I expect that to continue
And then importantly a little less than half of our gross margin expansion came directly from our quality of sales initiatives
We across our businesses, we reduced promotion and discount levels and we're able to pull that through in terms of gross margin
So I do see that as a durable tailwind for us as we move into the future
So Michael on your question, since Investor Day, what we've seen is that as we signaled in our FY 2018 guidance, we still have quality in the sales initiatives work to do as we move into FY 2018. And especially in the first half, we expect a sequential recovery in the second half
What’s giving us confidence in operating margin expansion, in a constant currency basis is that we have two strong pistons in the engine, both gross margin expansion and our increased confidence in that
And increased confidence that we can deliver our SG&A savings that we laid out
You'll see that in our results this year and you will see it as we travel through to FY 2018.
Yes, let me start with your question on North America
As you look at our results in our trends on a year-to-date basis the primary driver of what’s happening in North America is a result of our strategic actions
First, if I just take this quarter, about half of the revenue decline was attributable to our efforts in the Way Forward Plan to really match our inventories to demand in this quarter that was about - that attributed about half of the decline that we saw
The other component, about 30% was a reduction that we took to lower excess inventory, to the value channels and wholesale
So as we said, we think we’re out of balance today and we are aggressively moving to right-size that balance
So that’s a part, as you look at the trend, a great deal of that is attributable to what we’ve decided to do as a part of the Way Forward Plan
When we have a supply chain that is closer to market and closer to demand, when as we continue to improve our ability to buy informed, we believe we can get back to share growth in our wholesale channel, and that would be a propellant to growth for us as we move forward
Sure Kate, let me take that
Obviously let me step back from the question and to say that we are a very proud American company
We are and always will be intrinsically tied to Ralph’s vision of the American dream
We are headquartered in New York City and directly employ over 15,000 Americans
That said, there’s not a lot of clarity right now on the various proposals and specifically the Border Adjustment Proposal and there’s a lot of speculation
We are taking that very seriously and are closely monitoring any decisions made by the new administration
We’re obviously looking across our supply chain and looking for opportunities to mitigate any impact that we might see
As a part of the retail community we’re playing a role in that community to put forth the impact that this kind of action could have
So we are looking to - as we look forward, of course we will comply with any new legislation
This has been our practice and move swiftly to mitigate any of those actions
But right now we’re looking at scenarios and alternatives and waiting to see what legislation will actually be enacted
Dave, well foreign tourism was still down in this quarter
We are seeing a sequential improvement to what we saw in the first and second quarters of this year
So still pressured in foreign tourism but a significant improvement from what we saw as we exited the second quarter
And certainly the declines are about half of what we saw in the same quarter last year, so overall improvement
So Stefan is going to be fully on Board through May 1st, and we're going to work very closely on the transition
That said, this is - we have a very strong capable team of leaders around the globe
And so it’s with that team that we will be working together to ensure execution of the Way Forward Plan
This is in no way a one person leadership team
It’s a strong leadership team with a strong bench
It might be a little self-serving to say that Stefan's brought in a great bench of new talent, but set that aside, part of building this strong foundation and part of Stefan’s contribution is the great talent that he's brought into the company to blend with an already strong leadership team
And I know that like me many of us joined the company, because we really believe in the brand, the strength of the brand and Ralph’s enduring vision that’s the touchstone of the brand
So we are going to secure execution and move forward as a team
Erinn, I just want to be very clear
The 15% premarket commitment versus 60% is not a reduction in the order book
It’s actually a timing trend that we, in our past had placed 60% of our orders before we had the orders from our wholesalers
The change is that now only 15% of our orders because of longer lead times have to be placed before we meet with our wholesale partners and receive their feedback and orders
So it’s not an order book reduction
It’s actually moving that commitment date out so that we can be perfectly aligned with our wholesale partners
Good morning, Lindsay
Lindsay, I just want to add that Ralph is not interested in running the business day-to-day
He does want to play an active role in the creative decisions, including design and consumer facing decisions
In terms of reporting relationships, reporting relationships to Stefan will say the same through May and then well, Ralph and I and Stefan will work on an organization structure that make sense to ensure the execution of the plan
Yes, so Bob, I think we’ll come back and give more specific guidance as we typically do on the fourth quarter call
What we’re seeing now at this stage of our planning for FY 2018 is we will expect quality of sales initiative in retail and wholesale to continue to pressure revenue and comps through the first half, and then as we move into the second half much of that quality of sales initiatives and distributions will start to abate and you’ll see a sequential improvement in performance
That said, it’s really FY 2019 where we would expect to return to revenue growth
Sure, Ike so in the fourth quarter we have one opening and we’re on track as you mentioned for 50 closures this year
As I look at the model and current pressures right now at current spot rates I'm expecting about 50 to 75 basis points of pressure on operating margin
I think we have to see what happens on currency rates
Overall what I can say is that on constant currency basis that we’ll have operating margin expansion in FY'18.
Sure
Yes we are anticipating door closures with our retail partners
In fact as of the end of the Q3 we have worked closely and collaboratively with our department store partners and have worked through about 70% alignment on the point of sale closures that we announced last quarter that would reduce our points of distribution in department stores by 20% to 25%
So we are well underway there
We’re obviously working in partnership with them to understand their future door plans
So that we’re fully aligned on that
And that’s incorporated into our overall guidance
So about between door closures and wholesale closures it’s about 200 basis points of pressure
So I feel that we are aligned with our partners and we’re modeling that into our guidance
In terms of the right balance with what I’ll call off-price wholesale, what we know is a touchstone [ph] is that we have to be where the consumer wants to shop
And so they are an important part of our distribution
But what we also know is that we are not in balance where that distribution should be
So what we’ve modeled is continued rebalancing of that channel through the balance of FY 2018 and that will be down significantly double-digits as we move through FY 2018.
Good morning, Dana
So, Dana from the team as we've said, we have one significant search out there and it is for a Chief Marketing Officer
We're making progress, but that’s the most significant search that we have right now for the team
So the pieces that we talked about in the Way Forward Plan remain
We are going to evolve from a classic iconic core and continue to execute 50% new, 50% DNA, classic product, I think it’s the direction of that product that will evolve
And Ralph is going to play an active role in evolving that
You will see our progress in the Way Forward Plan, specifically on product starting in fall of - fall of 2017 and continues through into the spring season
So we are making progress, you will see it evolve and it will continue to evolve from there
It’s been part of our D&A as a company
We've evolved for the past 50 years, and its Ralph’s intention to continue that evolution
I want to thank you for joining us today
I look forward to speaking with many of you shortly and through the quarter and we're committed to executing our plans and providing you transparency on our progress and moving forward
