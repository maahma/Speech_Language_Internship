Thanks, Ken
Good afternoon, everyone
I’m going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I’ll then review guidance for Q2, and turn the call over to Larry and Mark for their comments
As you can see, we had another good quarter
Customer adoption of our Cloud products and services continue to be very, very strong and our on premise business remains very resilient
The result was that total revenue where at the high end of my guidance and earnings per share beat my guidance by $0.01. Today, I’m going to do what I always do, which is use constant dollar growth rates on this call, so we can have some measure of consistency across the quarters, as well as to reflect how we measure the business
The effects of currency movements in Q1 were a little better than expected with a 1% tailwind to total revenue
Total Cloud and software revenue were $7.4 billion, up 8% in constant currency and 9% in US dollars
GAAP applications total revenue were $2.6 billion, up 17% and GAAP platform and infrastructure total revenue were $4.7 billion, up 3%
Cloud SaaS revenue for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 61% from last year
Cloud PaaS and IaaS revenue for the quarter were $403 million, up 28% from last year
As our SaaS business continues to scale and grow dramatically, the gross margin has expanded
The gross margin for SaaS in the quarter was 67%; up from 59% last Q1. We expect to see further improvement in FY 2018 and remain committed to our goal of 80% SaaS gross margins, possibly as soon as sometime in FY 2019. The gross margin for PaaS and IaaS was 44%, down from 58% last quarter as our geographic build-out goes forward in response to demand, but ahead of the bulk of the revenue recognition
When we are at scale, I expect to see major improvement in PaaS and IaaS gross margins
Total Cloud revenues in the quarter were $1.5 billion, up 51% from last year
Total on-premise software revenues were $5.9 billion, up 1% from last year reflecting continued high attach of software support and renewal rates that reflect the stability of our installed base of on-premise customers
Hardware revenues were $943 million, down 6% and services revenue were $860 million, up 5%
Total revenue for the company were $9.2 billion, up 6% from last year
Non-GAAP operating income was $3.8 billion, up 10% from last year and it’s been a while since we last reported double digit operating income growth as we undertook the Cloud transformation that affected our income statement trading upfront revenue recognition of on-premise license revenue for recurring subscription Cloud revenue
With Cloud now in larger and more predictable share of the revenue mix, I expect that we will see additional strong operating income growth
The operating margin was 41%, which was up from 39% last year
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25%, which was over a point higher than my guidance, negatively impacting EPS by $0.01 or so and EPS was still up 12% in USD and 11% in CD to $0.62. The GAAP tax rate was 14.5%, and GAAP EPS was up 19% to $0.52 in US dollars
Operating cash flow over the last four quarters was 14.8 billion, up 8%; and free cash flow over the last four quarters was 12.6 billion
Capital expenditures for the quarter were 473 million
I expect that Cloud CapEx spending will be driven by our ARR growth and the PaaS, IaaS build-out that I mentioned earlier
Obviously, should we see higher than expected ARR growth we would expect to see higher CapEx investments as well
We now have nearly $67 billion in cash and marketable securities, but net of our debt our cash position is about 13.6 billion
The short-term deferred revenue balance is 10.3 billion, up 9% in US dollars
As we’ve said before, we’re committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend
This quarter we repurchased 10.2 million shares for a total of nearly 500 million
We are currently planning on bringing that rate up significantly for Q2. Over the last 12 months we’ve repurchased 46.6 million shares for a total of 2 billion
And we also paid out dividends of 2.8 billion
The Oracle Board of Directors again declared a quarterly dividend of $0.19 per share
Now to the guidance, and I’m going to give you guidance for Q2 and my guidance is on a non-GAAP basis and in constant currency
However, there has been some currency movements and assuming current exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency could be as much as 3% positive on total revenue and $0.02 positive on EPS
So here we go, Q2, Cloud revenues, remember these are constant currency numbers so you are going to be adjusting them for US dollars
Cloud revenues, including SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS are expected to grow 39% to 43%
Total revenue growth is expected to range from 2% to 4%
Non-GAAP EPS in constant currency is expected to be somewhere between $0.64 and $0.68, up from $0.61 last Q2. That puts the USD number in the range between $0.66 and $0.70 at today's exchange rate
This assumes a non-GAAP tax rate somewhere between 23.5 and 25.5 of course as usual tax rate could end up being different as it was this quarter
With that, I’ll turn it over to Mark for his comments
We’re actually holding over 10 more points on the PaaS IaaS right now because we’ve had a lot of orders and we are deploying them and we will only start recognizing them as they deploy
First of all, all of our Cloud customer is a very large amount of it, it hasn't been fully out deployed
So you are going to start seeing these match up a lot more as we go ahead and deploying get those up and running and alive
I don’t know Mark, you want to add anything or…
For USD, I’m going to go through the entire thing in USD for you guys because you’re not the only note
In fact, you're not the only note
So, I’m going to go through it
For total Cloud 41% to 45%
It really comes out like 4.5 to 6.5, but I’m going to say 4% to 6% and in total revenue and then EPS $0.66 to $0.70 and making EPS growth somewhere between 7% and 13%
Yes they are all like
And it’s a fair question because there are a bunch of rounding, it is 5 to 7, 4 to 6 it’s somewhere in the middle there, so I am always being conservative so I will say 4 to 6 on this call for you, but you know me
Was there another question?
So it’s a little bit complicated because there is a mix between IaaS and PaaS
PaaS in particular is extremely, extremely, extremely profitable and however there’s really a question of when the revenues get recognized and how much investing I have to do and how we line those up
So, we are just like you signed SaaS I know that it’s a time, it seemed absolutely impossible that we would have the kind of margins we now have an SaaS, it seemed impossible and yet they came and now we’re closing in on hitting, so much so that I actually went ahead and gave you some time next year for that hitting
PaaS and IaaS are very much at least at this point in the expansion period
We expect this to be a very large business that we remain very conscious of the margins, and so we’re trying not to invest too much ahead of revenue recognition, but as you see in this quarter alone we have a law that has yet to be deployed, fully deployed even though it’s fully provisioned even though the equipment is all bought and being capitalized
So this is really, I can’t give you an exact time because we’re going to be very much monitoring demand and reacting to that
And for us it is much more important that we expand quickly, of course mindful of margin dollars
Sometimes not as mindful necessarily of any intra-quarter margin percentages
So, I don't know if you want to add anything to that
