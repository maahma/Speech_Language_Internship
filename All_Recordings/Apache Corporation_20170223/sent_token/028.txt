Our objective going forward will be to deliver returns-focused growth and our plan to support this objective includes: budgeting conservatively and maintaining flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; continuing our focus on costs and well optimization to maintain the structural efficiencies achieved over the last two years; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we have an extensive high quality inventory; initiating an optimized development program at Alpine High; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; and, finally, actively managing our portfolio and redeploying capital to higher-value opportunities
