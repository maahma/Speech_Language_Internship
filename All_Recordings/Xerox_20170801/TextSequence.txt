Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone
I will start on slide 6 with an overview of our financial performance
Overall, I would characterize Q2 as demonstrating operational progress, realized expanding margins and cash flow with a mix story on sales, where we had a significant amount of foundation building revenue generation activities, but we have not yet seen the benefits come through in the top line
Revenue in the quarter was down $226 million or 8.1% in actual currency, 6.4% at constant currency
We had anticipated, as stated during Q1 earnings, that Q2 revenues would be the weakest of the year, given product launch timing coupled with Q2 having the most challenging compare
That played out, driven by equipment revenue declines that were weak, given the significant product transition
Post sale revenue decline of 3.9% in constant currency was in line with the first quarter rates and our expectations
Turning to the cost ratios, we continued to see good progress
Savings from our strategic transformation program during the quarter more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction currency impact of 100 basis points or $27 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points
Within that, gross margin expanded 50 basis points
R&D as a percentage of revenue was flat and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 10 basis points as a result of the higher revenue declines
As stated last quarter, within our definition of operating income is equity income, almost entirely related to Fuji Xerox, which was down year-over-year
I should note that equity income in Q2 did not include any out-of-period impact from the resolution of the Fuji Xerox accounting practices review
It was determined that our share of the final Fuji Xerox adjustment of approximately Â¥40 billion was approximately US$90 million, which was higher than the original estimate of $30 million and deemed to be material to our current year financial results
Accordingly, we will be revising prior period results, including Q1 when we booked the estimated $30 million charge for that matter
We have provided in our materials the revisions for the past three years
Turning to the below the line items
Other expenses net of $34 million was $14 million better year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense
Tax rate of 27% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28% and was higher by 8.5% year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.09 impact year-over-year in the quarter to adjusted EPS
Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.87, which reflects the one-for-four reverse stock split was down $0.11 from the second quarter of 2016, driven by the higher tax rate and lower equity income as cost and expense declines including lower interest expense roughly offset the impact of lower revenues
GAAP EPS was $0.63 in the quarter
The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement related costs and amortization of intangible assets
Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue
Starting with total revenue
From a geographic sales channel perspective, North America was down 7.3% or 6.9% in constant currency and represents 60% of our revenues
International represented 35% of total revenues and was down 8.9% or 4.6% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we continue to see overall improvement in developing markets
The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, with the largest piece over 50% being our OEM business
As I highlighted earlier, the driver of the higher declines in the U.S
and Europe was equipment revenue as post sale revenue trends were stable
Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 16% or 14.6% in constant currency with the highest declines coming in Managed Document Services and in the public sector, where sales cycles and product transitions and certifications are longer
From a product offering perspective, entry equipment sales were down 9.8% or 8.6% in constant currency, reflecting a higher mix of lower-value products as the strongest activity was in the developing markets and in the lower A4 product classes, as well as continued high OEM equipment declines
Mid-range was down 17.6% or 16. 3% in constant currency and this is where we saw the impact of not having the new A3 ConnectKey products available for the entire quarter
Lastly, high-end equipment sales were down 15.9% or 13.9% in constant currency as the growth with the high end in color Aqueous Inkjet was not enough to offset mono declines
Moving on, post sale revenue was down 5.7% or 3.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with Q1. We continue to see softer Managed Document Services revenues following weaker signings in 2016 and the first half of 2017. In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment
Declines are driven by the more mature large enterprise segment of the market as our SMB-focused channels, Xerox Partner Print Services and GIS, which comprise almost 25% of our MDS revenues, were growing mid-single digits
I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a few of which I've already touched on
Strategic growth areas to-date are down 0.7% in constant currency and comprise 39% of our total revenues year-to-date, a 2 point mix shift from the year-ago period
Growth areas were impacted in the quarter by lower equipment sales and MDS revenue
Jeff highlighted earlier, the headway we're making in advancing our strategic growth areas, and we continue to target our revenue mix to these areas by approximately three points this year
Turning to installs
Installs grew in entry, although at a weaker mix, given the better developing market performance, where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio and given the new ConnectKey A4 products that currently are available are at the lower end of the portfolio
Mid-range installs declined given the new product transition timing and more challenging prior-year compare
At the high end, installs were down in mono and within color results were mixed, with growth in Aqueous Inkjet offset by softer iGen activity, driven by last year's drupe-related partner and sales and a mix down within entry production color, where we didn't get a full quarter's benefits of the new Versant product
Signings in the quarter of $643 million were down 6.5% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency
We had strong contributions from renewals this quarter at a renewal rate of 86%
This was more than offset by lower new business signings
So we have work to do to improve the growth rates at MDS, especially in large enterprise
We have recently changed the leadership in MDS, and we expect investments, which include our new products and SMB expansion actions will drive improvement in revenues over time
The last key measurement area is strategic transformation
We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important element of our strategy to drive both expanding margins and to support investments to improve our revenue trajectory
I get a number of requests from investors to expand on some of the actions we're taking under the program, and would like to take a minute to describe a few of the initiatives
Within facilities, we are consolidating locations, 79 thus far, with more planned at the balance of the year
As an example, we moved our headquarters to a smaller location at favorable terms, resulting in a couple million in annual savings
Within service delivery spend, about 30% of our savings program, we are consolidating our service delivery for MDS and break/fix taxable service under one management umbrella and optimizing our resources
We are leveraging more remote cell and cell phone technologies, which are further enabled by new generation of product
This will result in, among other things, greater dispatch efficiency and also enable greater machine uptime leading to better customer satisfaction and more pages printed and more revenue
In supply chain, we're negotiating with vendors for better terms and have outsourced activities
We've closed five major warehouses and a number of district part centers, which combined will drive around $24 million in annual savings once fully implemented
Within IT, we are consolidating vendors in areas like mainframe support, moving to shared environments and leveraging more cloud tools to enable greater customer self-service in areas like billing and collection
And within SG&A, we are advancing our resources to the smaller size of our business following the separation in driving to get some functional spend areas closer to benchmark
We've reduced spend that layers in a number of areas and we're leveraging more technology to become more efficient in how we get work done
We're also tackling legacy infrastructure areas like Europe, where historically, it's been more difficult to make changes, to streamline our operations and create more shared services in areas like selling support
Lastly, our transformation program is not limited to costs
We're applying the same program diligence to drive better revenue performance
Examples of some of these initiatives include using inside sales personnel to call an underpenetrated account and improving pricing tools and resources to give selling hours back to reps and minimize revenue lost on the table
So all in all, a very broad company-wide program with a rigorous process that we work at every day with the goal of not only driving margin expansion, but also in making us more efficient and competitive
Before covering cash flow, I'll cover the trends we're seeing in how we anticipate they will play out in the back half of the year
The total revenue decline of 6.4% in constant currency in Q2 was below trend as discussed, driven predominantly by equipment sales
We continue to expect full-year constant-currency revenue to be in the mid-single digits with about one point of negative translation currency, a modest improvement to our previous assumptions
Looking at the second half, consistent with our previous commentary, we expect improving equipment revenue trends
Q3 should improve over Q2, although we won't get the full quarter's benefit from all the new products or realize larger deal, mostly MDS benefits, given the inherently longer sales cycle on these deals
Thus, Q4 will represent peak revenue performance for the year, with further benefits extending into 2018 with post sale, which lags, should also begin to reflect benefits from our initiatives
Operating margins show good sequential and year-over-year improvement in Q2. Transaction currency again dampened margins in Q2 by about negative 100 basis points year-over-year
At current rates, we expect more moderate impact in the second half, especially in Q4. Overall, we anticipate continued strong margins in Q3, although seasonally, Q3 is not as strong as what we'll see in Q4, where typically margins peak for us
For the year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin between 12.5% and 13.5%
Lastly, in looking at the trends for adjusted EPS with two quarters left, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $3.20 and $3.44, essentially chopping out the top end of the range as that relied on a more rapid rollout of the new products
We expect EPS to follow the trend in revenue with peak performance in Q4. Q3 is seasonally the second weakest quarter of the year after Q1 and historically has made up about 24% of full-year EPS
I'll now shift to discuss cash flow
Operating cash flow generation coming in from continuing operations in the quarter was strong again at $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year
And free cash flow was $322 million, up $101 million year-over-year
Cash flow was driven by working capital timing and improvements, including in accounts payable related to the timing of supplier and vendor payments, the impact of lower equipment sales, a benefit to both accounts receivable and finance receivables, as well as the weighting of pension contributions to the second half of this year
Through the first half, we have contributed $46 million of a planned approximately $350 million for the full year
Investing cash flows were a use of $77 million and included $65 million related to a GIS acquisition and CapEx spend of $21 million
Cash used in financing was $80 million and reflected $68 million in dividends, both common and preferred
So overall, we continue to feel good about cash flow and are maintaining our full-year guidance of $700 million to $900 million in operating cash flow from continuing services
Turning now to capital structure slide, I will spend a few minutes on debt
We ended Q2 with $5 billion in debt, which is consistent with Q1 ending debt balance and lower than 2016 ending debt balance of $6.3 billion, reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments we did in the first quarter
As we highlighted previously, a focus area for us in 2017 is getting our capital structure aligned to the new Xerox
We have made good progress and we continue to look to ways to optimize our balance sheet
Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.6 billion is allocated to financing debt, calculated by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our customer financing asset of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $464 million of equipment on operating leases
And I will remind everyone that this financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage
So to summarize, we continued to make operational strides in Q2 with strong margins and cash flow and a good setup of revenue for the balance of the year
With that, I will hand it back to Jeff
Yeah hey, Katy, it's Bill Osbourn here
Thanks for the question
So let me just give some thoughts to you on all the four measures that we give a little guidance on, on the adjusted EPS
But first of all, adjusted operating margin, we gave guidance at 12.5% to 13.5%, reaffirming that
We're very comfortable with where we're at year-to-date, 13.3% in Q2, first half at 12.2%
And just to remind everyone, the third quarter is typically our seasonally our second weakest quarter of the year, but Q4 is our strongest from an operating margin and from a revenues perspective
But we're still very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13. 5% range and believe we're set up pretty well for that
Revenues mid-single-digit down in constant currency for the full year; first half, we are 5.4% down
We believe the second half will be better than the 5.4% down at constant currency with once again Q4 being the strongest quarter of the year and Q4 being better than Q3. From an operating cash flow perspective, once again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we ended for Q2 at $343 million, $533 million for the first half of this year
And I think most everybody knows and I'll just remind everyone the timing of our pension payments we gave guidance towards $350 million in pension payments for the full year, which is still on track, but only $46 million were made in the first half
So a lot of the pension payments are back loaded
There's also some timing of payables, with payables management that was a help in the first half that won't necessarily repeat in the second half
So then after all that getting to your question regarding the adjusted EPS and really, there a lot of factors as you can imagine that go into it
There are some favorable things in particular
Currency, we think based on current spot rates, will be a little bit better than we had expected as far as the headwind at the beginning of the year, in particular in Q4. And Q3 will probably be similar as far as the negative impact to the first half of the year, but Q4 we expect to have a more modest negative impact from a currency perspective
The Fuji Xerox provision is clearly a favorable item
And in the first quarter, we took that $30 million hit on that and that was revised $24 million or most of it was revised out
So, some favorable items there, but to get to the higher end of the range, a few things
We had â everything had to go right regarding the product transition, and Jeff, in a lot of his comments talked about that
A lot of things have got right, but not everything as far as the timing
There have been some delays
Also, we still plan
We've done a lot of investment year-to-date in the A4 area, which everyone knows has a negative margin upon the initial sale in most cases, but is profitable over the life of the equipment
We plan to have â we want to have flexibility, continue to do as much of that as we can
We've done a fair amount in first half
We want to continue doing that in the second half of the year
And this, leaving â to answer your question specifically, leaving the lower end of the range opened or not adjusting that leaves you opportunity to be flexible, where opportunities arise in the A4 area
And then, one of the bigger things is that, from a tax perspective, we gave guidance range of 25% to 28% for the full year for effective tax rate
And year-to-date, we've been in the 27% range
We think that might be lower a little bit with some things you see and maybe in the second half
But still, it is higher than the midpoint of the range so far this year
All those things factor in
We thought it was prudent to narrow the range, given half the year is up and we basically removed the top 25% or $0.08 from it
Just a little bit on a strategic cost transformation
As everyone knows, last year we overachieved with respect to the $500 million target and achieved by $550 million
In 2016, we stated a goal for $600 million, this year we are very pleased with where we're at year-to-date, and believe we are firmly on track to meeting that target and hopefully exceeding it
Which would lead to, obviously, your $1.15 billion, if I'm doing my math right, that we're likely very much on the plus side of the $1.5 billion for the three years when you factor in 2018. But as far as formally giving an updated number, it'll probably be later this year
But we are very confident in being â hitting the $600 million this year and overachieving on the $1.5 billion
But to give updated three-year number later this year, we'll give that
A couple of thoughts
So yeah, I'd agree, this incremental about $500 million over three years versus what was more BAU already on the cost reductions
But one of the main reasons why was to allow for investment and investment includes things like the A4s, being able to sell A4s up front, which are at a negative margin or a loss initially but profitable over the life
But it also offsets other headwinds, such as currency
We've had significant currency headwinds, both last year and this year, and the incremental amounts over the BAU allowed us to still increase margins despite those currency headwinds, and like I said, it allows us to do investments, so the investment in selling initial A4s or investments in the way we are doing things internally
Yeah, I would say clearly, it would be a mix that there would be a mix of investments
But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future
Thanks for the questions
So, yeah, regarding the Q4 versus Q3 from a revenues perspective, a couple of things
You're right that Q4 seasonally our strongest quarter from a revenues perspective each year and that normally occurs
This year, we expect there to be even more of a ramp, the degree of it, we're not giving that specificity, but more ramp than normal because of the new product launch
Not giving specific guidance as to flat or positive for Q4, but as far as Q4, it's owned
But we do expect there's a normal ramp from Q3 to Q4 that occurs
We expect there to be more of a ramp this year than in prior years just because of the full availability of our products at that point in time
As far as EPS and operating cash flow, once again, there are a lot of variabilities, as you know, that go into operating cash flow
And one of them in particular is the pension contributions, and we've said $350 million
It's an area that we look at closely as far as our funded pension status
And just want to leave things open from the perspective of whether we want to have flexibility for maybe additional funding there
But yes, normally, all else being equal, you would â you could have a slightly less, actually operating cash flow because taking off the top, but it's not that significant compared to all the variables that go into determining it
