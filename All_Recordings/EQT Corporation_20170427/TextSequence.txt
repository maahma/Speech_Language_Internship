Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everybody
Before reviewing first quarter results, I want to highlight our recent acreage acquisitions
During the quarter, we completed two acquisitions, adding 67,400 core Marcellus acres for $652 million funded with cash on hand
We've been very active consolidating our acreage position in our Marcellus core, increasing our position by over 222,000 net acres, which represents the most Marcellus acres acquired by a single producer since 2015. On the pricing side, we have seen significant improvement throughout our various markets
The average realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 realized in the first quarter of last year
This stronger pricing environment was also reflected in our average differential for the quarter, which was negative $0.13 per M
This is a $0.54 improvement from the fourth quarter of 2016 and a $0.09 improvement from the first quarter of 2016. The improved pricing also highlights the value of our diversified firm capacity portfolio, which provides significant takeaway capacity to premium markets
During the quarter, additional contracted capacity and higher utilization of this capacity to move our gas to these markets resulted in both higher realized price and higher transportation costs for the quarter compared to our guidance
We expect continued improvement to our realized price as incremental pipeline projects come online, including the MVP pipeline, which will provide access to the premium Southeast market
As you will see in our updated slide deck, we expect our basis to improve from negative $0.25 in 2017 to negative $0.13 in 2019, based on forward pricing at our markets
I'll now provide a brief overview of the first quarter results
As you read in the press release this morning, EQT announced first quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.43 compared to $0.05 in the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating cash flow attributable to EQT increased to $322 million as compared to $217 million in the first quarter of 2016. As a reminder, EQT Midstream Partners' and EQT GP Holdings' results are consolidated in EQT Corporation's results
EQT recorded $86.7 million of net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $82.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. Starting with Production results
Production sales volume of 190 Bcfe for the first quarter was 6% higher than the first quarter of 2016, which was on the low end of our guidance, as we completed fewer wells than we had planned for the first quarter
As discussed, the realized price, including cash settled derivatives, was $3.50 per Mcfe, a 33% increase compared to the $2.63 in the first quarter of last year
Operating revenues totaled $828.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, which was $345 million higher than the first quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses at EQT Production were $571.2 million, or 17% higher quarter over quarter
Transmission expenses were $43.4 million higher due to volumes moved on Rockies Express Pipeline and the Ohio Valley Connector
We were paying for some Rex capacity last year, but since we were unable to physically move our produced gas to Rex in the first quarter of 2016, we used that capacity for marketing
When we use pipeline capacity for marketing, we net the cost of the transportation against the recoveries realized
The cost of the pipeline capacity used to move our produced gas is recognized as an operating expense
The increased transportation expense this quarter was largely due to us using more of our own transportation capacity to move our gas, driving higher transportation costs and higher realized prices
Processing expenses were $16.7 million higher, consistent with higher wet gas volumes
Production taxes were $6.2 million higher as a result of better pricing
Gathering expenses and DD&A were all higher, consistent with production growth
Excluding a legal charge of $5 million, SG&A was essentially flat, while lease operating expense, excluding production taxes, were $1.6 million lower
Moving on to midstream, EQT Gathering income was $73.6 million, $1 million higher than the first quarter of 2016 on increased gathering revenues, partly offset by increased operating expenses
Total operating expenses were $28.7 million, or $3.3 million than 2016. Looking at EQT Transmission, operating income was $71.5 million, 11% higher than the first quarter of 2016. Operating revenues were $13.3 million higher over first quarter 2016, primarily due to EQT's firm commitment on the OVC, or Ohio Valley Connector, which was placed into service in October 1, 2016. Operating expenses were $29.6 million or $6.3 million higher than the same quarter of 2016. And then finally, our standard liquidity update, we closed the quarter in a great liquidity position with zero net short-term debt outstanding under EQT's $1.5 billion unsecured revolver and about $857 million of cash in the balance sheet, which excludes EQM
We currently forecast about $1.3 billion of operating cash flow for 2017 at EQT, which includes approximately $200 million of distributions to EQT from EQGP
So we are fully capable of funding our roughly $1.5 billion 2017 CapEx forecast, excluding EQM and EQGP, with that expected operating cash flow, as well as the current cash that we have on hand
With that, I will turn the call over to David
Morning
Arun, I think that the frac pricing is probably going to be up more than that 15%, but that's offset some by actually declines on the drilling side, because we had some older rig contracts that were at high prices that rolled off
So that's kind of a blended number across all the services
I think a big part of that is the processing costs, because of the acquisitions that we've done and the mix of wet and dry gas has gotten a bit wetter for us
And so, the processing costs go up, but then so do realizations
And some of it is also due to transportation where we're using more of our capacity to transport our gas as opposed to using it for marketing purposes which again also, it increases transportation costs, but also increases realizations
One thing to keep in mind on that is, we've only got Upper Devonian that we want to develop on about 20% of the core Marcellus acreage
So in the long run, that's probably a ratio that you would see
But in any short period of time, the mix can be meaningfully different
Yeah, I think big picture, what you see is that the volumes are going to increase significantly in the second half of the year
And so, the per unit cost on a number of items will start to come down
I think that's the big picture answer to what we'd expect to see on a per unit basis
Yes
Maybe I'll answer the first part of that question and I'll let Steve or Dave answer the second part
It is important to us to maintain an investment grade balance sheet
There's a number of reasons that we've articulated in the past
And so, we will be cognizant of that when we think about how we would fund any future acquisitions
But we do have both debt capacity and equity markets available
And so, if the acquisitions make sense, we will be able to fund them and we'll manage the debt-to-equity mix to keep â€“ to be sure that we stay on the right side of the rating agencies
