Q2 results include revenue of $1.5 billion, up 5% versus last year
GAAP operating earnings of $257 million, up 15% from last year
Non-GAAP operating earnings were up $4 million to $328 million
Operating margins were down 80 basis points to 21.9%
GAAP earnings per share were $0.78, up 28% from $0.61 in the year-ago quarter
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12, up 9% from $1.03 last year
Ending backlog was $8.5 billion, up $265 million from last year
Products backlog was up $204 million and Services backlog was up $61 million
Additionally, aged backlog for the remainder of the year is higher than at this point last year
For the remainder of the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial results, including those in our outlook, unless otherwise noted
Q2 Product sales were $848 million, up 6% from last year, driven primarily by the Americas
We saw growth in every region, reflecting significant demand for our P25 LMR systems
Q2 Products segment operating income was $193 million or 22.8% of sales, up 80 basis points from last year, driven by higher sales and lower OpEx
Gross margins were down, as expected, on higher system sales as well as inefficiencies associated with implementing our new ERP system during the quarter
For the full year, we continue to expect gross margins to be comparable to last year
Products segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.6 billion, up 15% or $204 million from last year, driven by North America
This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth
Sequentially, Product backlog was up $1 million
Turning to Services
Q2 Services revenue was $649 million, up 3%, including $20 million of currency headwinds associated with Airwave
Managed & Support Services grew 3% or 7% in constant currency
Services operating income was $135 million or 20.8% of sales, down from 23.5% of sales last year
As expected, the operating margin decline was attributable to Airwave
We continue to expect full year Services gross margins to be comparable to last year
Services backlog ended at $6.9 billion, up $61 million from last year, including approximately $500 million of Airwave backlog reduction
Sequentially, Services backlog was up $3 million
Total OpEx was $367 million, up $4 million from the year-ago quarter
Excluding acquisitions, OpEx was down as expected versus last year
We continue to expect full-year OpEx to be down $10 million to $15 million inclusive of acquisitions
Other income and expense was $51 million, down from $57 million in the year-ago quarter
Net interest expense was $51 million compared to $54 million a year ago
The Q2 effective tax rate was 31.6%
Turning to cash flow
Q2 operating cash flow was $173 million, a decrease of $190 million from last year, primarily due to working capital timing associated with the ERP implementation
Free cash flow was $120 million, a decrease of $81 million from last year
On a year-to-date basis, both operating cash flow and free cash flow are up compared to the first half of 2016, and we continue to expect approximately $1.225 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. We ended Q2 with cash of $805 million and net debt of $3.7 billion
During the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of stock at an average price of $83.59 and we paid $77 million in dividends
We also announced our intent to acquire the Airbus PlantCML business
Turning to our outlook; we expect Q3 sales to be up 3% to 4% versus last year and non-GAAP EPS between $1.36 and $1.41. As Greg mentioned, for the full year, we are raising both revenue and EPS guidance
We now expect full-year 2017 sales growth of 3% to 4% and non-GAAP EPS of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes approximately 170 million fully diluted shares
Looking at regional results; Americas revenue was up 7%, driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services
Backlog was also up year-over-year and sequentially in Products and Services as customers continue to invest in LMR systems
EMEA was down 1% due to approximately $20 million of UK currency headwinds, while Products was up 12%
Asia Pac was up 2% on strong product performance driven by P25 demand in Australia
Services was down on lower systems integration, while Managed & Support Services was up
I'd like to end with some notable highlights
During the quarter, we signed the FirstNet partnership agreement with AT&T, and we are encouraged that all states that have made a decision to-date have opted into the plan network
Additionally, during Q2, AT&T certified our LEX F10 FirstNet device, making us the only vendor with both a handheld device and a vehicular modem that is FirstNet ready
Some key product wins include a $43 million award for P25 devices in a major U.S
city; a $40 million P25 system in Broward County, Florida; and a $10 million P25 devices order in Australia
In Services, we secured a 10-year, $160 million contract for Managed & Support Services in Canada and a $90 million P25 system award covering three counties in Kentucky that includes a 10-year Managed & Support Services agreement
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg
And Tavis, this is Gino
With respect to gross margins, in the release, we don't have the gross margin by segment
But as expected and recall during our last call, the guidance, our expectation was for gross margin to be down, driven primarily by a few things
One was Airwave FX and the purchase accounting adjustment, catch-up adjustment year-to-date in 2016. That would be obviously reflected in the Services gross margin, as well as a shift to systems in North America
Greg mentioned and I mentioned in prepared remarks, the strength of systems in North America, as well as some ERP-related – ERP implementation-related cost in Q2. So Q2 margin down approximately 160 basis points, spread across really those three issues
And I should say, as I said in the prepared remarks, our expectation is that gross margin in both Services and Products we expect to be comparable for the full year
And through the first half, margins are comparable despite the Airwave FX headwind and purchase accounting adjustment
Margins through the first half are comparable
Yes
So we cut over in April and we experienced some typical issues, we plan for them
Inventory, specifically inventory, ended higher and a little bit in receivables
The inventory – the ending inventory was driven by some difficulties in our planning module in the ERP implementation system
And from a receivables perspective, we had some invoices that went out later and were outside of the terms and moved into Q3. We expect the implementation to be largely complete by the end of Q3. And the implications are contemplated in our outlook
As I said in my prepared remarks, our expectation remains unchanged for operating cash flow for the full year
I think it represents, at this point, an estimate for the composite total revenue
It could, to your point, include software and mobile applications
It could include Services activation
It could include the deployment of software we've developed, which interoperates and links, land mobile radio P25 with LTE networks
And of course, it could include a mix of devices, not just handhelds, but vehicular modems
So it's all of the above
It's a best guess, by the way
Most important of that is less the composition of how it comes in by product or software bucket but it assumes a certain loading level, a certain penetration level that we think is reasonable
But we'll have a better view of it in Q1.
Sure
Rod, this is Gino
Managed & Support Services have been growing in mid-single-digits for the past eight or nine quarters
It was purposeful
The design of – including the design of products and really, what's driving that, the underlying driver is, the technology becomes more and more complicated
It becomes more and more difficult for our customers to manage their own systems, and many of them look for us to manage the systems for them
So when we talk about the TAM around Managed & Support Services, what we're referring to is managing the systems that we have deployed
Kulbinder, this is Gino
Just a couple of comments
First comment being $700 million reduction in OpEx is a little bit more than incremental
That's the way as you described it
Greg mentioned, OpEx and OpEx associated with acquisitions
For the full year in 2017, the acquisition OpEx number is $45 million
Inclusive of that $45 million, our expectation is to be down $10 million to $15 million
Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) Okay, great
For Q3, Andrew?
Or for the full year?
Go ahead
So Andrew, we'll start with the year
Certainly, for the full year, our expectation is for growth and growth in both Products and Services and organic growth
In Q3, as you said, Airwave is not the headwind that we had in Q2. But our expectation in Q3 is to grow Products and Services and grow organically as well
On 3% to 4% for the full year?
I'm not sure
Maybe we'll go through the model and your math, Andrew
I'm not sure
Yes, for revenue amount
in 2017? About $50 million, $50 million to $60 million for the full year
