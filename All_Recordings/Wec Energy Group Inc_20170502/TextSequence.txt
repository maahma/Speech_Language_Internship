Good afternoon, everyone
Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter
I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations
Now, as you saw this morning, we recorded first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance
Effective cost controls, better than forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities help to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter
Scott will provide more detail in a moment
We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%
Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front
On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
Due to the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018, as well as 2019. This will make for a total of four years that base rates will be flat
This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019, and require us to continue to manage our cost aggressively
Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas
In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for two years
Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on the equity of 10%
All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers
We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers
Currently, 24 customers including three of our largest customers have signed the settlement agreement
We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supportive
As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers
These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs
These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms
The Commission formerly began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 28. Now, settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin, but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously
I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process
In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment
Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the Commission to consider and decide on June 1. Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies
Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin
The earnings from this investment as well as this risk profile are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies
I believe this investment will bring a very meaningful benefits to our customers
In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well
We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27. No substantive issues or concerns have been raised, and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year
In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project, if approved by the Michigan Commission
As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements which the commission approved
We would welcome a similar outcome in this case
Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program
I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain
Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program
The commission has requested that the record in the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision
And I expect an order in the fourth quarter
Finally on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint
ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder to being a member of MISO, thus increasing its return on equity to 10.82%
We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level
However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%
Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring its return on equity to 10.2%
When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity
We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan
We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns
Now, just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level
This represents the compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level
Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share
We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings
Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth
Now, with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Scott
So we'll now begin the question-and-answer period
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
So, Greg, I think as we look at our plan for 2017, our plan was to bring O&M down 3% in 2017 relative to the actual run rate in 2016, and that's still our plan
But given how extraordinarily warm it was in January and February, we use, what I've talked about before, our flex down process to basically flex down spending to preserve our margins in the phase of the very, very warm weather
So, I think 3% down year-over-year on O&M is still a good assumption sort of on a whether normalized basis, so to speak, Greg
Yeah, yes, the 3%
That's right
Yeah, it will be an increased in each of the future quarters compared to the prior year
That, we just put it in service in January this year at the end of last year
Yeah, it was just under $60 million
Thanks, Greg
So, Shar, those are just maybe a context for the others on the call, those were areas that American Transmission Company was targeting for development kind of outside their traditional footprint
In Arizona, they are working
They are looking at the feasibility of the number of transmission projects
My expectation is later this year
Can't really give you a specific date at this point, but they're actively looking at I think four different projects, and they would be prepared to propose some of those later this year in Arizona
And in Alaska, I don't have any update for you at this point in Alaska
It would be the latter, Shar
So we had $300 million of capital for what we called outside the footprint in the five-year plan
So whatever they propose there would be supportive of that $300 million
Well, there's nothing at least in terms of additional requirements, other than the retirement of Presque Isle we talked about, which is about a 360-megawatt coal unit
We've also talked about the retirement of Pulliam, which is a coal unit in Green Bay in the WPS Service Territory
So, other than those two retirements, I don't have anything additional to announce
I would tell you though, Shar, if you look at kind of our carbon reduction goal and maybe describe it in terms of annual tons of reduction, so what we ultimately would like to see is about a $14 million annual run rate reduction in CO2, and based on the things that we've already announced, so the Pulliam and Presque Isle, and the things that we've done at our gas plants, you could get roughly $7 million out of that $14 million
So based on what we've already announced, you could get $7 million out of that $14 million, and those actions â€“ not only would they reduce carbon, but they also would be a net savings to customers
Thanks, Shar
Yeah
So what we've said, and this is something that I've mentioned at least on a couple calls before this one, didn't go into as much detail on it on this call, but we look at a base of earnings in 2015 of $2.72 per share
And, Caroline, basically that $2.72, it effectively, it's like a pro forma number for the company as if we had never done the Integrys acquisition
So we set that base of earnings at $2.72 in 2015, and what we've said as a long-term matter is sort of think of an envelope where the bottom end of the envelope is a 5% compound annual growth off $2.72, and then 7% is the upper end of the envelope
What we said, as a long-term matter, we expect our actual earnings, the trajectory, to be in that envelope
So that's really how we've laid out our goal
Yeah, I would characterize it as long-term; I'm not sure anything is indefinite, but
but it's certainly long term
Scott, do you want to address that?
Hello, Michael
Yeah, yeah, my expectation at this point, Michael, and of course, I can't sit here today and say whether it's going to be for the rest of the year, but if you had sort of a normal weather for the rest of the year, I still think for the year, we'd be down 3% on a O&M
We would stick pretty close to that plan, if we had normal weather
If, for some reason, it's warmer or cooler than normal, well, I expect we'd adjust
Well, it's the first quarter, so we still have the winter season, so it's not the largest construction for us, unless we're finishing up our prior year project
So, the first quarter isn't the biggest construction, and remember, some of the construction we have and if the â€“ we talk about including the storage field that we're looking at purchasing, that's in the back half of the year, so it's a little bit back-end loaded
Let me just maybe as background for everybody, settlements, Michael, are quite uncommon in commission history â€“ in Wisconsin Commission history
So as a result, there is no prescribed settlement process in Wisconsin
And in some other states, you have some statutorily prescribed process for a settlement, you don't really have that here
So each settlement can be approached maybe in a somewhat different fashion
Sitting here today, I talked about the fact that the PSCW gave official notice of the proposed settlement on April 20. They indicated that they would soon set a date for a prehearing conference, and then if things work the way they usually work, Michael, they'd solicit comments after they do that prehearing conference
And then, they'll have to decide what process they want to use after that
But I would just reiterate, I mean there is very broad customer support for the settlement
So the 24 industrial customers that I talked about including the three largest customers that we have
Now, in terms of the role that other interveners would have, at this point, it's hard for me to say, and I mean I would assume they'd be like any other party in a contested proceeding
So, they wouldn't be any different than how they typically would be in a contested proceeding
That will be my expectation at least
I was just thinking through it because two of the large groups that are normally part of the process weren't signatory to your stipulation
So, just trying to think through how they factor in all of those
Well, I think where it stands, it was referred to an assembly committee, which of course is the lower house of the legislature, then it was also referred to a senate committee
At this point, there've been no hearings that have been scheduled at a committee level
So, that's where it stands, Paul
Paul, I believe they're in session until at least the end of May, and of course this is a budget year, so I'm not sure they can go home until they have a budget
But I think it's that the end of May, Paul, but we can get you a more precise answer offline
I'm not sure, I would just call it any more or less contentious than Wisconsin budgets have been
Unlike other states, they consistently have a budget
Hi, Dan
Sure
Yeah, the small class in our electric sales on a weather normalized basis, we calculate it to be up 1.4%
Now, like we talked about the quarter, it was extremely warm this quarter
So, normalization in this sector and all sectors is pretty tricky, especially when you're talking, with commercial, there is a variety of different commercial operations there
So, the class has always been a little stronger for us
And in our long-term forecast, we have about a 0.5% year here at for next year â€“ for this coming year
So, it was a good quarter, but once again, it was only one quarter, I'd still look at overall being about 0.5%
And that's what I see in high class
So yeah, we evaluate the pension, as you know, every year in March, intensely during the year, it gets us to be about fully funded about a 100% on a GAAP basis
So, we don't see any contributions in the near-term, but of course we'll continue to evaluate
Thanks, Dan
Hi, Steve
Steve, to my knowledge at this point, they have not set a date for the prehearing conference
Well, my view right now, Steve, would be that I'm going to wait for the commission to take some definitive action, either a definitive action that they approve the settlement or a definitive action that they reject the settlement
I think financially, we're just fine waiting for that definitive answer
So we'll wait
As I was saying in the prepared comments, I do think they'll act expeditiously, but there's just no prescribed process, so -
I think we really have to wait and see what happens
At this point, the interventions, they've raised their hand and intervened, but without even having had the prehearing conference, it's hard to know what their positions are at this point
And I did touch on it just briefly, but maybe just as kind of a review and summary
My expectation sitting here today is that we'll deploy about $300 million worth of capital over the course of the entire year on the S&P program
The Illinois Commission has asked for â€“ going back to the workshop proceedings, remember that they had last year â€“ they've asked for some additional information, I believe our deadline for filing is the middle part of May for that additional information, and additional briefs
And they've indicated that they would decide this year, so that's where we are with that process
But in the interim, we're continuing with the program, as we laid out in our three-year plan to them
Thanks, Steve
Good afternoon, Leslie
Right, on the electric side
Scott, do you want to talk about and go through that?
Well, you have a fuel band at both of the utilities, so that's the plus or minus 2%, so our outlook at this point, Leslie, would be that given normal weather, we would expect to be about fully recovered at each of the utilities, again for electric fuel
No
At this point, I wouldn't project to be ahead of plan
Or ahead of fully recovered
Yeah
We're starting in the first quarter, when you look at first quarter 2017 versus 2016, we are seeing a slight uptick in that frac sanding sector
So, it's nice growth
Remember, frac sanding is, I think when you look at our sales of the gas side in Wisconsin excluding residential, it's between 1.5% and 2% of sales, so it's a nice grouping and we did see a nice little uptick there
That is correct
So, those are the iron ore mines that â€“ that's what we look at with and without those
The large C&I, that has been relatively flat just â€“ once again the economy is â€“ it's moving a little bit, but those sales have been very flat in the last several months, quarters
Thank you, Leslie
So, there are the two large mines in the UP of Michigan
So, these are the Cliffs Resources mines
So, Paul, and I always mix up the names, but one of the mines is roughly a third of the usage up there, and that's the one if you remembering is going down into shutdown
The other mine which is about two-thirds, which is the Tilden mine, that's the larger of the two and that's the one at least the Cliffs has indicated that they're going to run for the long term
Correct
I think that actually was closing last fall, previously, it was shut down â€“ I think it's actually closed now
Well, I think and I didn't listen to their call, their earnings call, but my understanding at least is, if they see an uptick in demand, could they sell to steel mills obviously, if they see an uptick there, they would be poised to increase production, but otherwise, I think they're going to be pretty flat, would be my expectation
Thank you, operator
