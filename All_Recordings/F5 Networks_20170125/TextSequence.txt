Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone
I was very pleased with F5 team’s performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2017. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 5% the strong profitability and operating margins
The highlight of the quarter was a return to product revenue growth, which will remain our number one financial clarity throughout fiscal 2017. We continue to make good progress on sales execution fueled by the vast array of new products that we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016 and the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Product sales in our Americas region continue to improve with another quarter of year-over-year sales product growth
Product sales in our APAC region were once again up year-over-year
And the start of the quarter was our Japan region with a very solid year-over-year increase
Product sales bookings in EMEA however, were again done year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the UK and Germany
Software revenues were very solid in fiscal Q1 driven by strong growth in virtualization software sales and strong growth insured security solutions
If we maintain our current growth momentum, we should exit fiscal 2017 on a $400 million annual trajectory for software sales
In security, we saw a sharp rise in the number of SSL interset project wins as well as some large multimillion dollar Gi Firewall competitive displacements in the service provider market
These trends resulted in double-digit year-over-year Q1 growth rates within our security product portfolio
We had some excellent sales wins in our service provider business last quarter with several significant NFV and Gi LAN, IoT and large firewall security win
We also saw a solid demand for our 100-gig blade sales in Q1. The 100-gig blade product is proving to be very popular with customers that require massive scalability
Once again our services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 8.5%
As Andy mentioned, we are seeing as expected slowing year-over-year services revenue growth related to the slower product sales in FY 2016. We expect our services revenue growth trends to begin to normalize in the second half of the year as product revenue continues to grow
In mid-November, we announced the second phase of the iSeries product range of appliances known internally as the Shuttle series
The initial customer reaction to the announcement has been excellent
And sales in Q1 have exceeded our expectations
Initial sales of the new iSeries products are tracking slightly above the trends we have seen in previous product refresh scenarios and we believe this bodes well for fiscal 2017. Last quarter we talked about several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with service providers and the enterprise customers
We gave examples of new opportunities including the explosion of SSL encrypted traffic and the need to intercept, inspect and orchestrate encrypted traffic at speeds and volumes never before required
We also spoke about customers emerging desires to have consistent security policies across traditional on-premise data centers as well as private and public clouds, as the movement of application workloads to cloud architecture accelerates
We experienced many project wins last quarter, which reinforced our view of these expanding opportunities
For example, a Fortune 100 insurance company leveraged a new F5 iSeries 5000 platform to deploy the next-generation private cloud infrastructure
This implementation allowed them to instantly orchestrate, provision and dismantle ADC resources and concert with our existing Cisco infrastructure
This customer also deployed F5’s ASM product ensuring WAF functionality was available to on-premise applications as well as a private cloud data center assets
A Fortune 500 discount retailer with a large online and mobile clientele required an improved security perimeter for its online web presence
They also required a solution to deal with the onslaught of encrypted ECC traffic triggered by the recent adoption of this encryption method by companies like Apple, Google and Microsoft
This customer deployed six VIPRION chassis in combination with a Silverline deployment and this was anti-DDoS an encrypted traffic management solution
In a 5 million plus transaction, a large Asia Pacific Telco operator initiated a 5 year program to virtualize 100% of its IP transport network and chose F5 as its primary ADC provider
This deployment leveraged many cloud-based orchestration and automation technologies including OpenStack and KVM
The solution consisted of F5 virtualization software licenses as well as our carrier-class firewall, our WAF and access management software modules
We will be demonstrating this solution as well as many others at Mobile World Congress next month in Barcelona
We are continuing to experience momentum in our customers’ effort to lift and shift from traditional on-premises to private and public cloud environment
This past quarter one of our long-time North American customers, a leading learning management system provider began such a transformation
Working together with AWS, F5 crafted a dynamic and secure traffic management solution utilizing F5’s WAF and firewall capabilities in the AWS computing environment
This enabled our customer to easily repurpose many of their legacy data center applications to the public cloud without compromising the mature security capabilities they enjoy with F5. In recent quarters, we have seen growing interest in our Internet of Things capabilities and have enjoyed successes with several Fortune 500 customers
In Q1, one of the largest global manufacturers of home appliances invested in F5’s VIPRION platform to help facilitate machine-to-machine communications within their massive base of install products
The F5 solution leveraged a full stack of traffic management and security offerings including dynamic service chains and a highly scalable SSL deployment
F5’s leadership and scalability, programmability and diverse protocol support is ideal for managing complex IoT requirements
From a product roadmap perspective, you should expect to see F5 continue to introduce several exciting new products through fiscal 2017. Today we announced the addition of several new offerings to our security portfolio
The new Herculon product family with purpose-built hardware and the simplified user experience, lets security administrators quickly deploy solutions that overcome specific application security obstacles and threats
Herculon products provide improved visibility and control over application behavior and solve difficult industry challenges in a straightforward easy-to-deploy manner
The first two offers available in the Herculon portfolio are the Herculon SSL Orchestrator and the Herculon DDoS defender
The Herculon SSL Orchestrator provides improved insight for customers experiencing growth in the volume of encrypted application data
Today most web traffic is now encrypted and attempts to address application security using traditional methods alone are both inadequate and costly
The Herculon SSL Orchestrator provides leading cryptographic capabilities contacts aware dynamic chaining, service chaining and native third-party integrations
Herculon SSL Orchestrator can significantly increase performance while significantly decreasing infrastructure costs by eliminating the need for redundant encryption and decryption capabilities
The Herculon DDoS Hybrid Defender offers customers an unparalleled multilayered defense against volumetric and pervasive DDoS attacks
This is accomplished by developing high performance hardware on-site and enriching its capabilities with intelligence gathered from our cloud-based Silverline scrubbing centers
This hybrid approach improves time to mitigation in scenarios where website and application availability are crucial to customer interactions
The product provides comprehensive DDoS coverage through behavioral analytics, subsecond attack mitigation, and visibility into sophisticated application-layer attack
Also announced today is our Silverline WAF Express service as more and more of our customers prefer a web application security as a service approach to attack mitigation
We are introducing a preconfigured offering that leverages our cloud-based Silverline platform
By their very nature WAF deployments can be complicated
With WAF Express customers can protect applications with a point-and-click simplicity, while our security operation center experts monitor, analyze and mitigate attacks as they occur
We also announced today that we have added security and incident response team services for all F5 customers to help them more quickly identify and neutralize threats and to help protect their critical business operations
We plan to ship TMOS 13.0, known internally as the Daytona release, in this current quarter
Daytona is a major release with a host of new functionality, including our high-performance 40-gig virtualization; a sophisticated but easy to install iApp for our SSL Orchestrator; VCMP support for the 100-gig blade, which should extend the 100-gig blade solutions to enterprise customers; and IoT/MQTT protocol support
We also plan to deliver our unique application connector solution in Q2. Our application connector enables customer applications to seamlessly access multiple public cloud infrastructures directly from private clouds in on-premise and/or co-lo data centers
This provides a truly flexible and elastic hybrid cloud solution to our customers
Finally, we are planning to deliver the first release of our container micro services based solution, internally known as Project Velcro
Velcro includes two products that work together, the container connector and the application services process
We have been beta testing Velcro in several micro services environments and we are excited by early indications that it will enable an entirely new category of F5 solutions with our new application services process
We believe this product will play a pivotal role in accelerating our customers’ ability to adopt emerging mode two and container-based architectures in both private and public cloud environments
As far as the fiscal Q2 outlook is concerned, Andy outlined our guidance for the current quarter
We have made good progress in all our key strategic initiatives
The vast array of new products delivered in the second half of fiscal 2016, combined with the exciting roadmap of additional products planned for this quarter, should drive solid business for F5 during the year
I believe we are poised to see increased growth in year-over-year product revenue in Q2 and we have every opportunity to build in that momentum for the second half of fiscal 2017. In conclusion, I’d like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners, and customers for their support last quarter, and with that we’ll now hand the call over for Q&A
Question-and-Answer Session
Okay
Yes, good
On the first one, on service provider, actually I felt really good about service provider last quarter, especially in Americas
We had a really, really solid performance there where we saw a lot of wins with the GI firewall replacing the existing – and I’m talking multimillion-dollar type wins
We saw across the board the 100-gig board had a real big jump up in terms of the number of cards shipped from the previous quarter, and then I talked about things like IoT where we think that’s pretty good, and we’re looking forward – we are actually going to have quite an exciting event at Mobile World Congress, showing a lot of customer-type solutions and partner solutions
EMEA did have a tough-ish quarter in service provider and that went hand-in-hand, quite frankly, with the overall toughness we’ve seen, but I was pretty happy with the results
In terms of the product refresh, I think I caught the question, but if I didn’t, Andy, excuse me, will correct me
But as we’ve said in the past, we tend to see in the first few quarter of shipping, 25% of those – that product type to be the new product
This is looking very good for that to happen
As we said in the script, we’re very, very happy with the way that – the reception from customers, A, from the ones that we announced towards the end of Q4, and then for the ones that we announced at the end of Q1. We even saw quite a strong pickup towards the end of December across the board, and I know that the field are quite excited about it
Yes
Let me go with the software, first of all
I mean, we’ve talked in the past quarters about the percentage of product revenue being something like 77%
So, I think we’ve sometimes said 78%
And if you do the math in that, you can see I’m probably being reasonably conservative in the $400 million number because that’s typically in the 90s
So that was really just a measure to give everybody a feel for how much software we’re actually doing
Linearity, yes
The linearity last quarter was interesting
If you look at it at face value, it was fairly normal; however, what we did see was a little bit of a lull in the middle of the quarter, round about the announcement – before the announcement of the new VIPRION products
I don’t know if that was a slight amount of Osborne or not, who knows
But we saw that picking up to normality, so no real big – not much to talk about there
And then when we look at the pipeline, we think we’re going to see much of the same as well
Yes
No, no, DevOps is and – when I – this is John
When I talked about some of the new products of ruling for example a big one related to DevOps is that is a Velcro
That’s an internal name of our product
And that’s the micro services version of our ADC and Watson container architecture typed a scenarios
That’s really, really aimed at the DevOp community and I mentioned about F5, we’ve got bunch of beta test going on
So we think that’s an opportunity moving forward
To note only get the main serves of the DevOp community, but also to be able to drag other products along with it, software module security solutions, et cetera
And then also in the past we’ve talked about what we’ve been doing with iRules, with iRules LX and with iApps LX, again is very aimed at the DevOps community
So that in fact, we effectively the programmability is right in their center of excellence in terms of anyone to do that
So that those more and more solutions on the F5 platform, which so long story short, I think we do see DevOps is an opportunity
Do you want to share anything Ryan? Ryan Kearny Yes
So I just I had mentioned DevOps is something that drives our roadmaps and is a big focus area for F5 in our technology and the ability to support automated in – automation and orchestration ecosystems with open APIs and very flexible extendibility of the product and simplicity and usability are critical things
And that includes new technologies just like John said our container, conductors and our support of micro services, which we’re launching this quarter
Our pretty big focus areas and things were really going to be enabling many more kind of DevOps, architectures and environment
So we haven’t kind of past so
I bet as a lot of people smiling that one, everybody seems to smile when we talk about retire again
I mean just to give you an update on that, I’m not going too much detail here because obviously the sales process is the responsibility of the Board and the sales committee have involved in it, but it’s their responsibility
But the process is actually progressing really well
Obviously we’ll let you know ASAP when we get something to an own, but meanwhile my focus by a mile is focusing on the business and delivering another quarter, this quarter, another good quarter
And then the other things Julian, asking about Silverline, I think you missed in this script was, we’re very much using Silverline as a competitive advantage, just against cloud based solutions and other service solution
But also by integrating with your firewall and our WAF capability initiating intelligence, we think that a massive differentiator for us
Because of our installed on premise base, installed base so big we can get more and more intelligence for the cloud-based solution
It still equates more, but growing I mean I could give you a very big growth number, but that would be, it quite still equates more
And I think what we said and we suppose taking to this is as I guess bigger the Fed revenue in particular from a subscription point of view, we’ll start talking about it
I mean this is – I’m going to give you an answer
It’s a little bit dangerous, because as an assumption you can’t take us to the bank
However, everything we have seen right now is telling us, this is going to be a very, very similar product cycle previous ones
We’re seeing excitement in the customer base, we’re seeing quite take up of the new products
We think we’re going to be very, very similar from a percentage point of view, I mentioned in terms of this current quarter versus the previous ones
So we’ll see, but so far, so good
Typically, I might be wrong
It typically starts at 25%, gets up to about 80% by the end of the year
Yes
So you see four quarter
Thanks
There’s two things we’re looking at, and I think hopefully taking a conservative view is that EMEA has seen a few tough quarters here, so until we’re confident of success there, we’re going to take a conservative stance on that
Obviously, we mentioned services, and until we start to see the product growth coming back – there the main areas, but no – in terms of looking alone at the product stream, when I look at what I’m very happy about, it’s software sales, the VE sales, the cloud sales starting to rise with Amazon and Azure
Security was double digit and we feel reasonably good about that
But they were the two main areas that we took into account
I think, frankly, it’s probably a combination of macro and we could probably improve execution in certain areas, probably both
Thank you
And then in terms of the micro services type opportunity, we see that as – it’s mostly going to be east/west type traffic
It’s going to be in container architecture
We see that as an additional area to where we are today with our core business, which obviously is mostly north/south traffic, mostly application – optimizing applications in that environment
So, I don’t think there’s going to be a clash here
I think it’s more of an additional market type opportunity
On budget – budget flush is always a tough one to actually measure
I did mention that we saw a little bit of a lull, which could have been linked to the iSeries announcement, and then we saw a strong close at the quarter and some of that can be budget flush, but I wouldn’t say it was – it wasn’t incredibly significant
I’m sure we saw some, but I wouldn’t factor it as a big factor in the quarter
And then, the second question?
Okay
On the first one, I did mention that we had a pretty solid quarter last quarter with the security software solutions, which obviously is attach rate as well
In fact, I talked about double-digit growth, so we felt very, very good about that
We expect iSeries definitely to give us more attach rate; the performance is designed to do that
We’ve taken a number of restrictions, especially towards the bottom end of the product line that should help out as well, so generally we would expect that to be the case
Yes, I mean, we have become more and more positive, Paul, over the last year in particular in terms of the opportunity of the public cloud
I mean, one of the things that has been becoming very obvious, too, is when our customers – remember, we have a very, very large Fortune 500 customer base – when our customers are doing lifts and shifts to the public cloud, whether Azure, whether it’s Amazon, et cetera, that almost 100% of the time our products are going with that and that product being, it could be classic TMOS with programmability and iRules already included
It could be additional products like the WAF for protection or firewall or access policy management
And that’s one of the reasons we’ve been giving a lot of customer examples on that basis
So we’re working in the field with the AWS folks in the field; we’re doing the same with Microsoft
We’re viewing it as an opportunity, and in fact, I highlighted it as one of the three emerging opportunities that…
And also remember the studies we’ve done in terms of hybrid clouds, I mean, hybrid clouds is all over the place from the customer perspective
I can’t remember the exact percentage; I think it was in the 80 – but it’s a very high percentage of the responses we got where the large customers that we sell to are going into hybrid cloud environment
That gives us a massive opportunity, A, to make it happen and, B, to take advantage of it as we take our security and our mature products and make sure they are on the public side of that
It is, and it’s usually September where we have a very strong , I mean, what we’d say is we’re very, very happy with the sales execution over the last couple of years in federal
So we expect it to be strong, but this is far too early
