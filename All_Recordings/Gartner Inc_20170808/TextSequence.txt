Thank you, Gene, and good morning, everyone
In addition to discussing our quarterly performance and updated annual outlook, I'll spend some time this morning walking you through our new reportable segments and other disclosure highlights as a result of the CEB acquisition
Starting with our reporting segments; as you've all seen from today's press release, we now have four reportable segments, Research, Consulting, Events, as well as Talent Assessment & Other
Starting with Research
Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment, representing approximately 72% of our combined full year 2016 company revenues and approximately 80% of total gross contribution
Research comprises the previously-disclosed Gartner Research segment with two additions
First, approximately 80% of the revenues of what was reported as the CEB segment, these revenues relate to core CEB subscription-based research products and services, which we'll refer to primarily as BPDS
The other and significantly smaller change – change to the Research segment is that we have also included results related to strategic advisory services or SaaS
These revenues make up about 1% of Research revenues, but were previously included in our Consulting segment
SaaS revenues are principally generated from one- or two-day research analyst engagements requested by our largest clients, for which they pay an additional amount relative to their subscription service
Correspondingly, Consulting, which represents slightly more than 9% of our full year 2016 combined company revenues and 4% of total gross contribution, now no longer include the SaaS revenues that I just mentioned
Moving to Events, where we've added CEB's Events business to the Gartner Events business
CEB's Events revenues were predominately comprised of the Evanta asset that was acquired in May 2016. On a full year 2016 basis, Events represented approximately 9% of our combined revenues and 8% of total gross contribution
Finally, we've added a new reportable segment, Talent Assessment & Other, which we'll often call TA & Other
This segment is made up of CEB's Talent Assessment business plus the remaining 20% of CEB's segment revenues that are not included in our core research segment
These revenues are related to ancillary CEB Research products and services such as training, workforce surveys and leadership academies
TA & Other represented approximately 9% of our combined 2016 revenues and 8% of total gross contribution
For modeling and comparability purposes, we are also providing historical revenues, adjusted revenues and contribution margin for the combined company in our full reportable segments for the four quarters of 2016, as well as Q1 2017. This information along with an in-depth overview of our Q2 performance is available in the two documents we have furnished to accompany this call, both located on our Investor Relations website
While we have folded CEB into our reportable segments and added a new one, we are committed to providing the financial community with the appropriate level of transparency to be able to track the performance of the core CEB Research business
In addition, we want to provide transparency to be able to continue to attract the performance of the traditional Gartner business
On last quarter's call, I mentioned that we were in the process of harmonizing calculation methodologies to make key CEB metrics comparable and aligned with Gartner metrics
As an example, for the traditional Gartner business, our total contract value metric represents the annualized value of all our subscription-based contracts
While, CEB did report contract value, we have now recast that measure to be aligned with how we've traditionally done it with the Gartner business
In doing so, we have excluded certain CEB products and services that do not meet the criteria of our CV definition
You'll find the historical details of the recast contract value on slide 19 in our earnings presentation
Similarly, we have harmonized how we calculate wallet retention to also be consistent with how we calculate retention at Gartner
I will come back and discuss the trends of these metrics in a few minutes as a part of my quarterly segment review
We will also discuss our top-line results using both GAAP revenue and adjusted revenue
The only difference is that adjusted revenue excludes the deferred revenue fair value adjustment that is required as a part of purchase accounting
Turning to our Q2 performance, our year-over-year financial performance for the quarter included total combined company adjusted revenue growth of 9%, driven by 13% growth for the traditional Gartner business and a 3% decline for the acquired CEB business
Combined adjusted EBITDA $185 million and combined adjusted diluted EPS of $0.88 per share, above the top end of our guidance range for the quarter
Please note that our second quarter 2017 GAAP revenues of $844 million, includes an approximately $91 million deferred revenue adjustment
Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our revenue for the quarter was $935 million
Our exceptional business model continues to create a consistently high level of free cash flow conversion
On a rolling four quarter basis with three quarters of standalone Gartner and one quarter of Gartner plus CEB, our reported free cash flow conversion was 118% of adjusted net income
However, if we calculate free cash flow conversion on a rolling four quarter basis for the combined company, our free cash flow conversion would have been 126% through Q2. I'll now discuss our second quarter combined business segment and P&L in depth, highlighting the performance of the traditional Gartner and acquired CEB business where appropriate, before turning to our balance sheet and cash flow dynamics
I will then close with remarks on our updated 2017 guidance, which incorporates our new reportable segments
We will then be happy to take your questions
Please note that my segment discussion will focus on the adjusted revenue and adjusted contribution margin performance in Q2, therefore, adding back the deferred revenue fair value adjustment I just mentioned
Please also note that we've included a lot of this information in the presentations on our IR website
Beginning with Research
On a combined basis, adjusted Research revenue grew 11% in the second quarter
The adjusted gross contribution margin for Research was 68% or a 130 basis point decline compared to the second quarter of 2016 on a comparable basis
This modest decline is primarily due to our newer acquired businesses such as Capterra, SCM World and L2 having lower gross contribution margins than traditional business
Adjusted revenues for the traditional Gartner Research business increased by 15% in the second quarter
Acquisitions, primarily L2 and SCM World had a slightly less than 2 point impact on the traditional Gartner Research adjusted revenue growth for the quarter
Our other traditional Gartner Research business metrics also remained very strong with accelerating contract value growth, accelerating sales productivity and improvements in our retention metrics
Total contract value was almost $2 billion as of the end of Q2, FX-neutral growth of 15% versus the prior year, and an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter
For reference and comparison, our Q2 2016 total contract value at current-year FX rates was $1.73 billion
On an organic basis, excluding the contribution of L2, which we acquired in March 2017, total contract value growth for traditional Gartner Research would have been 14% on an FX-neutral basis, also an acceleration from the growth we delivered last quarter
We continue to drive contract value growth through strong retention rates and consistent growth of new business
From a traditional Gartner Research perspective, client retention was 83%, up 40 basis points from the second quarter of 2016, and up slightly on a sequential basis
Wallet retention ended at 105% for the quarter, up by almost a point year-on-year and 50 basis points on a sequential basis
Both of our retention figures are close to our all-time highs
New business growth for traditional Gartner Research remained strong, up 14% year-on-year in Q2. The new business mix is consistent with prior quarters and remains balanced between new clients and sales of additional services and upgrades to existing clients
And as always, we also benefit from our consistent price increases
Our new business growth reflects our success in penetrating our vast market opportunity with both new and existing client enterprises
We ended the first quarter with 11,164 enterprise clients, up 7% compared to Q2 2016. The average spend for enterprise also continues to grow
It now stands at $179,000 per enterprise, up 8% versus prior year on an FX neutral basis
This increase in average spend reflects our ability to drive CV growth through both new and existing enterprises
Turning to sales productivity for the traditional Gartner Research sales force
Over the last rolling four quarters, we delivered $265 million of FX-neutral net contract value increase or NCVI
When divided by our beginning of period head count, which was 2,297 quota-bearing heads, our rolling four quarter productivity per account executive was $116,000. Excluding the impact of the L2 acquisition, sales productivity was up 11% year-on-year and 5% sequentially
As always, we remain highly focused on improving our sales productivity and remain confident that the initiatives we have implemented to drive productivity will positively impact the results of both the short and long-term
Turning to the performance of CEB Research in the quarter; CEB adjusted research revenues declined by 1% year-on-year in Q2, an improvement from the 4% year-on-year decline in Q1. CEB's other research metrics also improved in the quarter
Contract value converted to Gartner's methodology was $578 million, a 1% year-on-year increase on an FX neutral basis, compared to a 1% decline in the first quarter
In addition, wallet retention also using Gartner's methodology ended the quarter at 94%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter
Moving to Events
As I mentioned at the start of my comments, our Events segment now includes the former CEB Events business, which is essentially the Evanta asset that CEB acquired in 2016, as well as CEB's destination events, which include the ReimagineHR and CEB's sales and marketing summits
The traditional Gartner Events business as you know holds more than 60 large destination events, such as our Symposium series for CIOs
Evanta holds approximately 200 smaller community-led events that don't require the attendees to travel
On a combined basis, adjusted Events revenues increased by 10% year-on-year in Q2. Events' second quarter adjusted gross contribution margin was 56%, down by approximately 200 basis points compared to the year-ago quarter
While CEB Events revenue was approximately flat on a year-on-year basis, the traditional Gartner Events business had a very strong quarter in Q2, with a 13% year-on-year increase in same-event revenue, a more than 100 basis point year-on-year improvement in contribution margin, and an 18% increase in same-event attendees
Turning to Consulting, on a comparable basis, second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% on a reported basis and 8% FX-neutral, driven by a strong performance in our contract optimization business
On the labor-based side, global head count of 667 was up 7%, and we had 128 managing partners at the end of Q2, a 14% increase over the year-ago quarter
Backlog, the key leading indicator of future revenue growth for Consulting business, ended the quarter at $91 million, down 1% year-on-year on an FX-neutral basis
Consistent with our new segment presentation, please note that our Consulting backlog no longer includes the backlog associated with SaaS
Consulting gross contribution margin increased by 160 basis points year-on-year, primarily due to the strong performance of the contract optimization business
Turning to TA & Other
Adjusted revenue in the TA & Other segment declined by 6% compared to the year-ago quarter
This was primarily due to a continuation of recent trends at TA
In addition, and as Gene commented, we moved quickly to address some of TA's legacy organizational issues, which we believe will drive improved performance going forward
Encouragingly, we did see some improved momentum towards the end of the quarter and ended Q2 with higher year-on-year bookings for the quarter
Moving down the income statement
On a combined basis, SG&A increased by 10% year-over-year in the second quarter
Our sales force continues to be our largest investment and as of the end of the second quarter, the traditional Gartner business had 2,574 quota-bearing sales associates
This is an increase of 277 or 12% from a year ago, and we continue to plan for approximately 13% sales head count growth for the traditional Gartner business in 2017. The acquisition of CEB adds more than 500 quota-bearing research sales associates
While this is essentially flat on a year-on-year basis, as Gene mentioned, we have already started to grow sales head count and we'll leverage our proven best practices around recruiting, training and tools to drive accelerated CV growth and improved productivity
As a growth company and now as a much larger growth company, we also continue to invest in areas such as recruiting, technology, facilities and other areas to support our strategy of delivering sustained double-digit growth over the long-term
At the same time, we're making good progress on cost synergies related to the CEB acquisition, specifically in G&A functions
Given the investments we have already made and plan to make through the balance of the year to drive accelerated growth in CEB's contract value, we continue to expect very modest net synergy flow through in 2017. We remain on track to deliver on our 2018 cost synergy target and are working very diligently to harvest as much of the $50 million as possible in 2018. Moving down the income statement; depreciation charges increased year-over-year in the quarter, predominantly reflecting the addition of CEB, while amortization and integration charges were up significant, again related to the transaction
Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35.4%
Adjusting for acquisition and non-recurring charges, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.9%
A lower than expected adjusted tax rate positively impacted our Q2 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04. This was primarily due to the timing of certain tax costs that are expected to be realized in the remainder of the year
We continue to expect our full year GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% to 34% and approximately 32% to 33% on an adjusted basis
GAAP diluted earnings per share was negative $1.03 in the second quarter
Our GAAP EPS figure also includes $1.91 of non-GAAP adjustments
Therefore, on an adjusted basis, our EPS in Q2 was $0.88 or $0.03 above the high-end of our guidance range, helped by the lower adjusted tax rate I just referenced
Normalizing for this, our adjusted EPS would have been approximately $0.84 in the quarter
Turning now to cash; in Q2, operating cash flow was $112 million compared to $148 million for the standalone Gartner business in the year-ago quarter
As I commented last quarter, CEB has historically had different cash flow seasonality at Gartner, where CEB's strongest cash flow quarter has been Q1, followed by its weakest quarter in Q2. On a combined basis, operating cash flow increased by 1% in Q2. It is also important to note that our Q2 operating cash flow includes significant acquisition and integration payments, which we adjust out for our free cash flow calculation
Pivoting the free cash flow, Q2 2017 CapEx was $31 million and Q2 cash acquisition and integration payments were $48 million, compared to less than $1 million in Q2 2016. This yields Q2 free cash flow of $129 million, approximately 50% higher when compared to combined company free cash flow in Q2 2016. The timing of our contract value growth is a key driver of our quarterly free cash flow performance and our strong research results from March and across Q2 have begun converting to free cash flow
Turning to the balance sheet; we had a busy quarter related to the CEB acquisition, which closed in early April
If you recall, on last quarter's call, I focused my comments on our post-close balance sheet rather than the end of March snapshot
Relative to the approximately $3.6 billion of gross debt we had as of April 5, we have repaid more than $160 million by the end of Q2, with a quarter-ending gross debt level of approximately $3.5 billion
From a net debt perspective, we had approximately $2.9 billion at the end of Q2, which translates to approximately 4.1 times leverage on a pro forma combined last 12 months of adjusted EBITDA
Given the favorable cash flow characteristics of the combined company, we remain firmly on schedule to de-lever to approximately three times gross leverage within the first two to three years of closing the acquisition
Turning to guidance; slide 13 of the presentation provides you with our updated outlook for 2017. As is our practice, our EPS guidance is on both a GAAP and adjusted basis
At a high level, our combined adjusted revenue outlook is unchanged, while we have tightened our full year adjusted EBITDA, cash flow and EPS outlook ranges
In addition, we have also updated our segment guidance to reflect our new reporting structure, which incorporates the CEB acquisition
And I'll also remind you that our full year guidance includes 12 months of Gartner plus 9 months of CEB results
Starting with revenue; for 2017, we continue to expect combined company adjusted revenue of between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion
This is comprised of the following
For Research, we expect combined adjusted revenues of between $2.57 billion and $2.62 billion
For the traditional Gartner Research business, we expect to continue our trend of mid-teen revenue growth in 2017. This is obviously supported by the very strong contract value growth we just reported
For Consulting, we expect revenues of between $319 million and $334 million, which essentially reflects the shift in SaaS revenue from the Consulting segment to the Research segment
For Events, we expect adjusted revenues of between $328 million and $347 million
For the traditional Gartner Events business, we continue to expect double-digit adjusted revenue growth in 2017. And for TA & Other, we expect adjusted revenue of between $214 million and $226 million
Again, these are adjusted revenue ranges, you will find the reconciliation of our adjusted revenue guidance ranges to GAAP revenue on slide 14 of the presentation
Turning to adjusted EBITDA; as mentioned, we've narrowed our expected adjusted EBITDA range for 2017, trimming the high end of our previous guidance range by $15 million
This modest reduction to the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance is driven by two factors
First, the vast majority of our change is due to our decision to accelerate certain frontline investments in areas that will fuel CEB's growth for the future
Given the rapid progress we have made so far with the CEB integration, we are confident of the incremental benefit this will yield going forward
The other and smaller change is to our outlook for the Evanta and Talent Assessment businesses, where we've had to focus on fortifying the structures we have acquired to set them up for future growth
As I commented last quarter, our GAAP 2017 earnings per share is expected to be significantly impacted by acquisition and integration charges, of which the vast majority are non-cash in nature
Slide 15 of the presentation reconciles the per share difference between our updated GAAP and adjusted EPS guidance ranges
We now expect the after-tax of these adjustments to total approximately $4.26 at the midpoint of our guidance
Putting this altogether, we now expect full year 2017 adjusted EPS of between $3.32 and $3.49 per share
Slide 17 details the key assumptions below EBITDA that we've used to calculate our updated adjusted EPS outlook
Given that our below-the-line assumptions are essentially unchanged, I won't take you through them in detail
For our tax rate, we continue to project an annual effective rate for GAAP of approximately 33% to 34% and for adjusted earnings of approximately 32% to 33%
In addition, our tax rate may also vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the projected geographic mix of earnings, the impact of ASU 2016-09 related to stock-based awards, as well as the timing of certain items
Finally, our EPS guidance is based on a weighted average fully-diluted share count of approximately 89.5 million to 90.5 million shares for the full year 2017. Turning to our Q3 guidance; for the third quarter of 2017, we expect GAAP EPS of between negative $0.67 and negative $0.72. This includes approximately $1.20 per share of non-GAAP adjustments, predominantly related to acquisition charges
Therefore, on an adjusted basis, we expect adjusted EPS of between $0.48 and $0.52 per share for the third quarter 2017. To provide some additional color on expected seasonal trends, third quarter is typically a seasonally light events quarter from both the traditional Gartner and CEB Events perspective, followed by a seasonally-strong Q4, where we typically generate half of our annual Events revenue
In closing, we had a strong start to the year and we expect this performance to continue throughout the balance of 2017. Our Research business delivered another quarter of mid-teens growth and contract value growth was 15%
We also saw acceleration in our CV growth, sales productivity and retention measures
Our Events business is on track to deliver double-digit growth in 2017 and Consulting delivered another quarter of growth following a very strong year-ago quarter
From a standalone Gartner perspective, our 2017 revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook is largely unchanged and we expect to continue our trend of double-digit growth
The addition of CEB further strengthens our ability to capture the best market opportunity ahead of us, as we are now able to address the mission-critical priorities of virtually all functional business leaders across every industry and size of enterprise worldwide
And the deal was immediately accretive to our bottom-line
As Gene mentioned, the integration is going exceptionally well
We set aggressive timelines, and we are achieving or beating them
This has given us the confidence to accelerate a number of investments, such as growing the CEB sales force to accelerate our ability to capture the vast market opportunity that exists
And it's important to note, we've done all of that while driving acceleration of performance in the traditional Gartner business
Now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions
Operator? Question-and-Answer Session
And Jeff, it's Craig
The additional color I'd add is we always contemplated in our longer term – mid-term and longer term business case, absolutely growing the CEB sales force over time, given the size of the market opportunity
I think given everything we've seen in the first 120 days, it gave us the confidence to actually pull that forward, because as Gene mentioned, the integration was going exceptionally well
We were able to actually get new products out in market sooner than we thought
And so, given all of that, we decided to pull forward essentially the investment in growing that CEB sales force
Yeah
Good morning, Gary
I think it's actually really a seasonality thing in terms of the calendar of the events schedule
So if you think about our business, spending is pretty consistent on a quarter-over-quarter basis, given the bulk of our spending relates to people on board
We've always had a skew that showed Q1 and Q3 as our lightest profit quarters and that's really driven by our events calendar with Q2 and Q4 being bigger event revenue quarters
We've only compounded that with the CEB acquisition, where the Evanta business is predominantly a Q2 and Q4 revenue generator
And in Q1 and Q3, there's essentially no revenues but we are carrying cost related to the team that delivers those events
And so I think, essentially it's just we are now just a little bit more heavily weighted in Q4 given the Evanta business
And the other thing I'd mention is last year's Q4, we did not perform as we wanted to on the Events business
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're actually back on track on our Events business
So, we actually expect to deliver nice growth in Events contribution in Q4 as well
So, it's really those two factors
And Gary, specifically it would be an impact probably most acutely on new business
From a retention perspective, we're working with our clients, we're making sure they're engaged and getting value and we'll continue to renew them, and as you saw, we actually saw a modest uptick in the wallet retention rate for CEB
So, the speed bump potential, again these aren't huge speed bumps, these are probably smaller speed bumps, but is really on the new business side
Yeah, sure
Hey, good morning, Tim
The way to think about it is, I think the majority of the change relates to us accelerating investments that we believe will drive great long-term value
So, think in the 60%, 70% of the change, balance related to some softness on TA and Evanta revenues
And also, quite frankly, investing with the right leadership and filling out the team so that we can actually deliver over the long-term in those two businesses as well, but think roughly 60%, 70% on the acceleration investment, balance on fortifying the TA and Evanta businesses
So, Tim, I think that the way to think about it is the acceleration on the investment are some of the things that Gene mentioned in his prepared remarks, so probably the biggest one related to actually starting to grow the sales force, again where CEB Research sales had been flattish, the number of head count over the last several years
And so, again we always contemplated as a part of our business case that because of that market opportunity, we talked about it a little bit earlier that we would be consistently growing the CEB sales force over time
The reason why we've pulled forward the investment or actually the better way to articulate it is, we started the investment a little bit earlier than we had originally contemplated is that number one, integration was going really, really well and we saw the opportunity to do that
Number two, if we get them onboard and trained over the course of 2017, while there'll still be new sales people, who inherently have lower productivity, they will actually yield some benefit in 2018. But again, you know the cycle of how, when we hire new sales people in year one, they're less productive, in year two they're a little bit more productive and then by the year three they typically look like a fully-tenured sales person
So in essence, we pulled forward the training and the hire – recruiting and training so that we can start the journey a little bit sooner than we had originally contemplated
It's a great question, Tim
The – what I can tell you is, through the end of 2017, we will breakout contract value growth and wallet retention for the traditional Gartner business and the traditional CEB business
It's harder to do the breakouts on revenues, segment expense and contribution margin
So we'll try and focus on the key operating measures so that we can show you progress both on the traditional Gartner side and on the traditional CEB side
As Gene mentioned, we all are fully integrating across the board, and that makes pulling and parsing some of this a little bit more difficult
As we head into 2018, there are some shifts in terms of CEB had a technology business selling to CIOs and technology professionals
We've already integrated that into the Gartner technology sales force
And we had a supply chain and marketing sales organization, and we're integrating that into the what was the traditional CEB sales force
So, the fidelity gets a little hard to track
That said, we'll figure out the right way to provide transparency and progress on was the traditional Gartner business maybe with a few tweaks based on those integration adjustments I mentioned and on the traditional CEB business, again with a couple of tweaks to reflect how we've actually integrated and are running the business
And Anj, it's Craig
I think the way to think about the potential trajectory around wallet retention, they're really two primary drivers there
Number one is what you typically think about around retention, which is making sure the clients are getting consistent value over the life of the contract and renewing year after year after year after year, and again we have best practices around how to do that and we're already as we mentioned earlier rolling out portions or all of those best practices across the way we service the CEB Research clients
The other way we drive wallet retention at Gartner is by further penetrating existing buying centers and existing enterprises, and with an enterprise-type licensing model, that's difficult to do
And that's also one of the reasons why it's so important that we're shifting to seat-based because over the long-term that will allow us to actually further penetrate organizations as well and that will flow through into the wallet retention metric over time
Again that's not going to happen overnight, but if you think about those two levers are the way that we can get wallet retention looking and feeling like the Gartner wallet retention over time
Singh - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
That's helpful
And then for the second question, I was wondering if you can speak to sales force productivity x-L2, that's – it's really strong improvement year-over-year, so any further elaboration on which training programs are driving this
Is there any benefit from lapping some of the energy and utilities-related drag you guys had referenced last year
And perhaps any thoughts on how you see sales force productivity being reported as you integrate CEB? Thanks
And the other I'd mentioned Anj and I think you know this from conversations with us over the years is there's no finish line for us in terms of productivity
We are pleased that we've seen some improvement
We're not done, we're going to keep trying to hire better people and improve that year-over-year-over-year and get them trained up better and improve the tools and improve the products and improve the research that impact retention as well
And so we're moving in the right direction and we're going to keep driving it
Because we know that ultimately improving our sales productivity will accelerate our contract value and research revenue growth
Good morning, Andrew (sic) [Henry]
It's Craig
On the margin side, if you think about from a business perspective, if you go segment-by-segment, our view is that the CEB Research products will run at roughly the same gross margin and incremental gross margin targets that we run the traditional Gartner business at
So, think in the 70% range
I think same thing on the Events side
We haven't really changed the margin profile all that much, and again we're trying to drive significant growth in both of those businesses and so I'd expect margins maybe on research to improve a little bit as we're tracking a little bit behind the 70% over time, but essentially kind of tracking where we are
The one thing I would say though on the gross margin is as we continue to shift the mix, so as research continues to be our largest by far and fastest-growing segment, we do get some gross margin leverage from continuing to have a bigger and bigger piece of the – research being a bigger and bigger piece of the pie over time
On SG&A, obviously on the G&A side, we're focused on harvesting cost synergies from the deal
And as Gene and I both mentioned, we are aggressively going after those
And some of them will be able to flow through in 2018; some of them will take a little bit longer just given timing of systems integrations and platform integrations and things like that
But on the sales side and given the size of the market opportunity, we expect to continue to invest in growing the CEB sales force to drive accelerated contract value growth on the traditional CEB business
And as we've seen on the traditional Gartner business, that is an investment upfront as first year productivity is low as we talked about earlier, second year productivity a little bit better, third year productivity starting to look like a fully tenured sales person
So, we're going to utilize the gross margin leverage we talked about earlier to continue to fund growth in both the Gartner sales force, again given the size of the market opportunity and the traditional CEB sales force to go capture that market opportunity over the long-term
The one other thing I'd add that is the – as Gene mentioned, the new seat-based products include the best of both, so in his example on HR, it's the great core CEB Research and deliverables and assets combined with the relevant Gartner technology
Research, that's really valuable to HR professionals
The legacy products won't have that, they'll be the legacy products
And so, as we continue to innovate and improve those seat-based products, I think over time, and this is what we saw on the Gartner journey from over a decade ago, clients will over time migrate over, upgrade over to the new products, because they're better
And they have more value and they'll get more value out of them
That said, we still have clients who are on legacy stuff
And again, as Gene mentioned, if they're happy and they want to keep renewing and keep paying us, we're happy to let them keep doing that
