Thank you, Bruce, and good morning, everyone
As Bruce mentioned, the strong performance of our individual Medicare Advantage franchise resulted in adjusted EPS of $3.49 for the second quarter, well ahead of our previous expectations
We also raised our full year 2017 adjusted EPS guidance to approximately $11.50 from our previous adjusted EPS guidance of at least $11.10, and we increased our operating cash flow guidance by approximately $200 million, due primarily to our better financial performance
As a percentage of adjusted full year earnings, we expect our third quarter to reflect adjusted EPS in the high 20% range, with the fourth quarter, therefore, comprising a percentage in the high-teens, as it incorporates the usual cost increases associated with the open enrollment season
I will now highlight the drivers of each segment's operating performance
Led by individual Medicare Advantage, our Retail segment continues to significantly exceed our expectations
And today, we raised our full year 2017 Retail segment pre-tax income target by approximately $300 million at the midpoint of the guidance range
Consistent with the early indicators we saw in the first quarter, individual MA medical utilization trends, including hospital admissions and pharmacy spend, are running favorably relative to our pricing assumptions, and we are seeing better-than-anticipated prior period medical claims development
We're also experiencing higher-than-expected revenue on a per member per month basis
Accordingly, we reduced our projected full year benefit ratio for the Retail segment by a full 100 basis points from our previous guidance
Turning to our other businesses, our Group and Specialty segment is continuing to have a solid year and, as a result, we raised our pre-tax target by approximately $20 million at the midpoint of the guidance range
The increase was driven primarily by positive prior period claims development and specialty results that exceeded our previous expectations as well as current year medical cost trends that are slightly favorable to our expectations
We continue to believe that a key element of our strategy is a focus on small to midsize employers as well as our specialty dental and TRICARE businesses, as each delivers steady cash flow and good returns on capital
The Healthcare Services segment continues to generate profits and steady cash flow to the parent and, importantly, reflects the integration of our business model by delivering clinical excellence and trend benders for our insurance lines
Consistent with the first quarter, we are continuing to see lower-than-expected pharmacy volumes, which reflect less health plan drug utilization than we had previously anticipated
In addition, while to-date, mail order rates are higher than last year, we are experiencing slightly lower penetration than we previously expected as some of our new standalone PDP members appear to be lower utilizers of mail-order relative to historical experience
Finally, the optimization of our chronic care management programs, whereby we are ensuring that our members are receiving the right level of intervention at the right time, is proceeding at a faster pace than initially expected, also contributing to lower Healthcare Services segment pre-tax than anticipated
As a result of these items, we have reduced our pre-tax guidance for the segment by approximately $130 million at the midpoint of our guidance range
To reiterate my comments from the first quarter call, this dynamic is positive for overall Humana, and we expect that the increase in health plan pre-tax income will more than offset the reductions in Healthcare Services segment profits, even considering that a meaningful portion of lower pharmacy utilization does not benefit the insurance segments, due to the corresponding lower CMS reinsurance and member cost share
These dynamics reinforce our integrated approach to running the business, taking a holistic, enterprise-wide view to drive business decisions that result in the best outcomes for our members, providers, and the company
To close our segment discussion, I will comment briefly on our Individual Commercial segment results, which are excluded from our adjusted EPS guidance
Our Individual Commercial segment is now expected to generate full year 2017 pre-tax earnings of approximately $85 million versus our previous expectation of a full year loss of approximately $45 million
These results reflect significant positive prior period development, which includes the net favorable settlement of a 2016 two hours (16:48) of reinsurance and risk adjustment as well as lower-than-expected utilization in our ACA on-exchange business
The strong performance we are seeing across the organization reflects our focus on operational excellence and the solid execution of our strategy
This will enable us in the third quarter to provide the Humana Foundation with a charitable contribution, reflecting our continued commitment to the communities we serve following the deal break
In addition, these results will enable us to spend incremental dollars on the Medicare annual enrollment period
Lastly, our compensation policies result in changes in compensation, both up and down, depending on our operating performance, with some years resulting in higher compensation levels relative to others
We are accruing compensation for 2017 based on the strong results we have seen across the company
As a result, we have increased the range of our full year consolidated operating cost ratio guidance by 25 basis points at the midpoint
Pivoting now to CMS Star ratings in our Medicare bids for 2018, we reported this morning that we now expect approximately 74% of our members to be in 4-Star or higher plans for the 2018 bonus year
We are pleased that we were able to significantly reduce the impact that the lower Star ratings would have had in our members in 2018 and that our final Star ratings reflect our commitment to quality products and services for our members
In particular, these ratings reflect our strong clinical HEDIS measures, which are record-high levels
It is, nonetheless, important to note that there were certain contracts that we chose not to consolidate and still others that we were not able to consolidate due to state regulatory limitations
Taking this into account and considering rebate implications from reductions in Star ratings for certain of our contracts, we still expect to have some Stars-related financial headwinds for 2018. With regards to our 2018 Medicare Advantage bids that were submitted in June, we continue to work very hard to offset the negative impact that the return of the non-deductible health insurance fee and the remaining Stars-related financial headwinds could have on our members and the attractiveness of our products more broadly
We are focused on continuing to drive cost out of the organization and expect to make progress in this regard in 2018. The process transformation office that Bruce referenced in his partnership with our various businesses is working diligently across segments to achieve increased productivity while improving and simplifying our core processes
Additionally, we have invested the 2017 outperformance I've discussed directly into our product designs for 2018. When combined with enhanced productivity, this has enabled us to keep benefits stable and competitive, and we believe will allow us to grow individual MA membership growth meaningfully in 2018 while maintaining our commitment to steady EPS growth
It is important to note that as we think about our 2018 earnings profile, our 2017 baseline remains our initial 2017 adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $11 at the high-end given the investment of the strong 2017 performance that I mentioned
Finally, I would like to reiterate our previously communicated capital deployment plans
As you're aware, we initiated a $1.5 billion accelerated stock repurchase, or ASR, in the first quarter of 2017, which we expect to settle in the third quarter
Upon completion of the ASR, we continue to expect to repurchase shares for the balance of the year and have flexibility to spend up to $750 million under our existing authorization
Additionally, as Bruce indicated in his remarks, we continue to explore ways to accelerate our strategy in the home and with providers, including with M&A and other partnerships or collaborations
As discussed at our Investor Day, our capacity for cash M&A is approximately $3.5 billion while allowing us to maintain our investment-grade ratings
With that, we will open the lines up for your questions
In fairness to those waiting in the queue, we ask that you limit yourself to one question
Operator, please introduce the first caller
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Scott
I would say that what we've seen is consistent with where we expected on both fronts – on both the low-income benchmarks as well as our direct subsidy calculations
And as the fall goes on, obviously, we'll talk more about what that means for us in our membership growth
Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Okay
Then just had a follow-up question, just on thinking about sort of the comments you made on investing for 2018 into the MA business on the upside and then given the improvements that you had on Stars in terms of the mitigation efforts
I know in the first quarter, you guys have talked about a view of MA industry growth running around the 6% range sort of over the next few years
How are you thinking about your ability to sort of return to that type of growth rate next year given some of the recent developments?
Well, as I said in my remarks, we do expect to grow meaningfully in the individual MA business
We're not prepared to comment today on where that will be relative to the market
But again, I think we feel very good about the product we've put on the Street
We've really endeavored to maintain stable benefits, and we think it will be compelling products for our existing members and also future members looking to enter MA
So there's a lot to unpack in that question
It is fair to say that, number one, we are going to put products in the market that do have stable benefits, which means we've overcome the health insurance fee
Obviously, it's going to vary by market
But on a national basis, I think that's a fair way to think about it
It's also fair to say that the $0.50 you're talking about was reinvested into product design
But I think it's important to think about really the MER element of it, the 100 basis points, that was reinvested into our product design
Some of the additional admin expenses that I mentioned around the foundation and compensation and other things are more one-time items
And so, I think it's important to think about the investment as really the MER outperformance
And finally, as it relates to the HIF
Remember, the HIF is coming back next year
And so it's not as if we could take that $2.15 and invest it in benefits
It's just that we didn't have to claw it back that perhaps others may have had to if they put that into benefits for 2017.
So again, I think it's important as we think about 2018, and I don't want to comment too much more on 2018, but to think about a baseline of $11 because we've invested this outperformance
We mentioned that in the first quarter, we would do that
We thought it was the appropriate thing to do to provide good benefits for our members and enable us to grow
And again, we feel good about where we stand
We do anticipate growing EPS
We've committed to our investors that we're going to have steady EPS growth, and that's certainly our intention next year as well as grow membership
So I'll go there first
It will be seamless for the member as it relates to the contract consolidation
So that won't be an issue in terms of the member won't see that consolidation
With respect to the EPS, I think it's important to use $11 as the baseline
And we hope to – obviously, our plan is to grow that number, and our expectation it would be above the $11.50 as well, but $11 is the baseline
And so as we think about growth rates, I think that's the way you should be thinking about 2018.
So I'm not prepared to comment on where we'll be on EPS growth because that would be giving guidance for 2018. We're trying to help you and give you context about how we're thinking about the year, but really not prepared to give specifics
I think what we try to communicate this morning is that we feel good about the product we're putting out for our members that will enable us to grow membership
And we also believe when combined with trend benders and some of the productivity initiatives we're working through will enable us to grow EPS in a steady way
So I appreciate the question, but obviously, we're not prepared to give 2018 guidance
What I will say is that it is true, as we articulated that we came into the year a little bit below our margin expectation, our long-term margin target
It's fair to say with this outperformance that we are above our margin target, and it's fair to say that our long-term target remains 4.5% to 5% on a pre-tax basis
But beyond that, I don't want to comment any further
Well, first of all, at the Investor Day, we talked about long-term growing at or above the market
We didn't comment on 2018, and I would just leave it at that
It's too early, really, to see what our competitors have done
The data still isn't out there broadly, and it's something we'll be analyzing in the coming months
But we're obviously, as an organization, gearing up for AEP, and we feel good about how we're positioned
So – good morning, Peter – we did know our Stars scores before we submitted our bids
So our bids incorporate the 74%
Well, again, what we've said is we're able to keep benefits stable and competitive and so we'll see where it shakes out, but we feel good about how we're positioned
Well, again, I think that's why we're being cautious
We don't know where our competitors are
As I said on a national basis, we're stable
I think there are clearly markets where we believe we can grow and we invested in and there are markets where perhaps we're not as well-positioned and we didn't invest as much
So we were, I think, very strategic about where we put our investments and our dollars to be able to maximize growth and offer compelling product for our members
But it is too early to assess where we are relative to our competition
But as Bruce said, we're working every angle and possibility we can to enhance growth including distribution
So again, we feel good about where we are
We'll obviously know more in the coming months as we see how we're positioned relative to our peers
So, that's definitely more than one question
We'll try to answer it, A
So when we refer to specialty, what we were talking about in that context was our Group and Specialty segment and specifically our dental business which has been outperforming
It's not something that we're prepared to quantify but it's a business that we don't talk a lot about but as I think done very, very nicely, membership higher than we expected as well as better claims experience
Secondly, as it relates to the home care side or the Humana At Home optimization as we called it and the mail-order side, those are both in our Healthcare Services segments
On the optimization side, as we said for a number of months now, we are spending a lot of time making sure that our members are getting the right level of care at the right time
And that the right interventions are happening
And so if someone, for example, improves or gets better and no longer needs our services, that's a member we won't touch as many times
And I think we're being a lot more disciplined and operationally rigorous in ensuring that the members who truly need the care are getting the care
And so we continued to see very good results, where the member is getting the right level of care and that's where we're focused
But that does have a pre-tax implication for Healthcare Services because as we reduce effectively the charges, the intercompany charges, to Medicare, Medicare benefits from a lower charge but Healthcare Services gets impacted because there's lower pre-tax associated with that because there's a margin there
And so again, I think that's important as we talk about the integration of our model that we're constantly looking at what is the best decision for overall Humana and more importantly for our members and their clinical health
On the specialty side, on the specialty – sorry, the pharmacy side, the mail-order side, what we're referring to there is our mail-order rate and, as I mentioned in our low price Walmart plan, which has been and continues to be a very successful plan and a very good partnership with Walmart, we are seeing a slightly lower mail-order rate than we had anticipated
We think it's probably because we made some tweaks to the benefit design that maybe causing some of those members to fulfill – to fill their prescriptions at retail rather than at mail
But again, overall, it's a – there's an impact on Healthcare Services, but there's only a small impact to overall Humana because of the way the co-pay structure works when someone fills at retail
And then finally – and I'm sure Bruce will comment on this as well, as it relates to home health, we continue to look at opportunities
We're obviously mindful of the rate release that came out
We're analyzing that and I'll just leave it at that
But it doesn't fundamentally change our strategy in the home and being able to engage with our members in a much more significant way in the home
Well, it's something obviously we do a lot of work around to try to understand what are the major drivers
We're clearly seeing the success of our clinical programs and some of our operational initiatives, what we call, trend benders
We are seeing an important advancement of our strategy there and we think that is why we're beating our operational targets, particularly on the inpatient side
On the pharmacy side, it's something that we continue to look through
I think – look at – I think we're seeing slightly lower trend than we had expected
I think that's really the major driver
There may be some mix issues there as well in the membership that we have, but it's something that we continue to analyze
And as we think about 2018, obviously, as we mentioned, we've reinvested those – that outperformance into our – in our bid design, we're obviously cautious about certain trends and whether they will continue
And so we're very mindful of trends that might continue and trends that might not continue
And so we, obviously, do a lot of analytics, a lot of actuaries working in figuring that out
So I think what we put into our benefit design for 2018 we feel good about
Well, it's fair to say that when we are in a full risk arrangement with a provider, they'll obviously get the financial benefits from that
About one-third of our members are in full risk arrangements
The other two-thirds are not
About 65%, including that 33%, are in some form of a value-based arrangement where we share in some of those savings
I think it's fair to say that everyone benefits when admissions go down
Obviously, most importantly, our members benefit and so that's where we're focused
But also, from a financial perspective, we want our providers to do well and have strong financial performance because that enables us to demonstrate to other providers who are thinking about taking risk with us that there are opportunities to do very well there
And so really, everyone benefits when we're able to drive down medical costs and admissions
As it relates to the Stars impact, it really has a similar impact
Depending on the arrangement that you're in, the provider will get a higher portion of dollars just because there's more premium going through the system
And if they get a percentage of premium, they're going to get more premiums
So they clearly share in the Stars recovery
Good morning, Christine
So again, it is the case that without commenting on our competitors, that the tax deductibility of the HIF, we did not reflect in benefits for 2017. And so, therefore, with the HIF coming back in 2018, we don't have to reduce benefits to effectively offset that or take an impact to margin, depending on what you want to do
That amount is something we don't have to address
And by the way, it was the reason why we did in the first place because we were concerned that we'd be in the situation and we want to try to be keep benefit stable, which we've been successful doing
With respect to margin, as I mentioned with a previous question, we are above our margin target
We don't expect, by definition, to bid above our margin target, so there should be an expectation that our margin target will be lower next year
And we're not prepared to give guidance around that, as we've talked about
As it relates to group MA, we continue to be selective in picking our spots
Our team is out there really pounding the pavement for opportunities
We feel pretty good about where we stand in the group MA business and looking at a number of prospects
But I would tell you that, as we said in multiple calls, we're going to be disciplined as we price that product
It's got to make sense from a return on capital perspective and from a risk perspective before we're willing to sign up, particularly for some of these large jumbo accounts
Yeah
I'm really not prepared to comment on group MA growth at this point
Again, there's a number of prospects we're looking at and the guys are doing a really good job, but I think it's just early to comment on group MA growth at this point
