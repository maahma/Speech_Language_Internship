Well, thanks, Nancy
Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us
The solid fourth quarter results we posted today nicely wrap up our 2016 year
And for the full year, consolidated net revenue increased 15.8%, with operating profit growing 8.3% and adjusted earnings per share increasing 13.2% with strong results across the enterprise
And the growth rates I'm citing are on a comparable basis and you can find the non-GAAP adjustments on the slides we posted on our website
Now, as expected, enterprise growth in the fourth quarter was solid with consolidated net revenues increasing 11.7%, operating profit increasing 4.6%, and adjusted EPS increasing 11.8% to $1.71, a penny above the high-end of our guidance
In the fourth quarter, operating profit in the Retail/Long Term Care segment was in line with expectations and operating profit in the PBM segment was ahead of expectations
We generated approximately $1.5 billion of free cash during the quarter and $8.1 billion for the full year, above the high-end of our guidance range
And we'll continue to be thoughtful and discipline with respect to using our strong cash generation capabilities to return value to shareholders
For 2017, we are confirming the EPS and cash flow guidance we provided at our Analyst Day in December, and Dave will review the guidance details in his remarks
Now, before turning to the business update, I want to touch on a few areas of investor interest
And let me start on the topic of DIR within the Medicare Part D program, so we can correct some false and misleading statements in the marketplace which suggested that DIR performance network-based fees represent a material risk to our company; a statement that could not be further from the truth
So here's what you need to know about DIR
First, DIR includes any rebates, any discounts or other price concessions that are unknown at the point-of-sale; and DIR, ultimately, is utilized to reduce the net cost of the Med D program
The second point; DIR performance network fees charged to pharmacies are allowed under CMS regulations
They're fully passed through from the PBM to their clients
They are fully disclosed as part of the annual bid process
And, again, are ultimately used and reflected to help lower member premiums
As a matter of fact, member premiums over a five-year period have increased at a CAGR of just 1.7%
So you can see the positive impact this is having on controlling costs
The third point, and for the reasons just mentioned, CVS Caremark does not keep or profit from performance network-based DIR
And as a reminder to everyone, both CVS Pharmacy and CVS Specialty participate in the same performance network programs being called into question
The fourth point, network pharmacy providers are proactively informed of, and educated on, program details including their forecasted financial impact in advance of program implementation
And the fifth and final point, any suggestion that Part D plans favor high-priced drugs to drive people through the benefit and into catastrophic coverage faster is erroneous, and the data proves that
In fact, the percentage of our beneficiaries reaching the coverage gap and ultimately catastrophic coverage has decreased over the past several years and is a relatively small percentage of our overall population
Now, we don't think DIR is likely to go away given its effectiveness in helping to lower premiums
But hypothetically, if it were to go away, there would be a level playing field, we would remain quite competitive, and we would not expect any material impact on our business
So I hope this clears up the gross misunderstandings surrounding DIR with the simple statements of fact
So with that, let me move on to the topic of the potential repeal and replacement of the ACA
We believe it's important to provide affordable coverage for all Americans, which both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged
However, at this point, it's extremely difficult for us to comment on the possible scenarios that may play out in the coming months
And that said, CVS Health can pivot to address policy changes, help reduce healthcare costs, and bring meaningful solutions to the marketplace
I also want to address the ongoing rhetoric around drug pricing
And whether it's new launches at elevated price points or increasing prices of older drugs, those contributing to a sense that government interventions are necessary and any suggestion that PBMs are causing drug prices to rise is simply erroneous
We are the solution and not the problem
And that's why both public and private payers continue to count on PBMs as indispensable partners that help to manage their drug trend
And numerous evaluations from the FTC, or the Congressional Budget Office and other government agencies have consistently concluded that PBMs operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to the healthcare economy
And our CVS Caremark solutions have helped reduce crime client costs from an unmanaged gross trend of 11.8% to a managed trend of 3.3%; and those results are for the first three quarters of 2016. In addition, a recent industry study showed that every dollar invested in PBM services returned $6 in savings for clients and members
So the value of PBMs is quantitatively pretty clear
And one additional topic that we've received a lot of questions about centers on the potential impact of corporate tax reform
As you know, we are at the highest end of corporate tax payers given our domestic profile, with an effective tax rate around 39%
And the details of tax reform certainly will matter, and today, while there's a lot of discussion, nothing has been reduced to writing
But suffice to say that a fairer tax code that includes a meaningful reduction in the effective corporate tax rate would allow CVS to unlock even greater economic opportunities
So we certainly look forward to continuing to engage in the dialogue around all of these issues that may impact our industry, our business, and the clients and customers that we serve
So let me turn now to the business update, and I'll start with the 2017 PBM selling season
Our gross and net client wins are slightly higher that at Analyst Day with gross wins totaling nearly $7.9 billion, net new business around 4.4 billion and a client retention rate of around 97%
And these numbers exclude enrollment results from our SilverScript PDP, which I'll touch on shortly
In addition, I'm pleased to say that we have had an outstanding welcome season, continuing our record of strong implementations over the last few years
We processed significant more transactions during this year's welcome season, and client satisfaction showed continued improvement across all business lines reaching record performance levels
And while we remain committed to improving and advancing every day, we continue to believe the investments we made in quality, automation and customer focus are delivering measurable value to our clients year after year
Looking ahead, we have about 23 billion up for renewal in 2018, which is comparable with prior years from a percent of business perspective
As for new business, it's pretty early to gauge the full extent of RFP activities in the 2018 selling season
And our strong service history, our size and scale, and our unique suite of capabilities gives us the tools we need to be successful in retaining business and winning in the marketplace as opportunities arise
Now, as we've discussed many times, top of mind for our clients continues to be managing their rapidly growing specialty trend
And we offer a comprehensive set of solutions and continue to see solid growth in specialty
And specialty revenues increased 12% in the fourth quarter, continuing to outpace the market
Our Medicare Part D business, SilverScript, wrapped up another successful annual enrollment period and retained its position as the number one PDP spots
We began the 2017 plan year with more than 5.5 million captive PDP lives and that includes EGWPs, and that's up about 10% from January of the prior year
When adding the Med D lives we manage for our health plan clients, the non-captive lives, the total rises to 12.3 million Med D lies under management
And you can find a reconciliation of the Med D lives in the posted slides
Now, moving on to the fourth quarter results and the Retail/ Long Term Care business, same-store prescription volumes increased 2%
That's on a 30-day equivalent basis
Total same-store sales decreased 0.7%, with pharmacy same-store sales up 0.2%
Our pharmacy comps were negatively impacted by about 380 basis points due to recent generic introductions
And they were also negatively impacted by the decision to restrict CVS out of the TRICARE network
And as we said on our last call, that network changes communicated in early October with a December 1 effective date
And we saw these scripts begin to migrate out of our stores during the fourth quarter and in line with our expectations
Let me touch briefly on the CVS pharmacies within the Target stores
And now that the integration is behind us, we're seeing improving script performance versus prior quarters; and this is being driven by the strength of our patient care programs and Maintenance Choice
The Target pharmacies have also exhibited a solid operational foundation providing high levels of service to our patients
So we're making good progress since completing the integration activities and moving in the right direction
In our Long Term Care pharmacy business, we continue to target the significant growth opportunities we see in the Assisted and Independent Living markets
And we're focused on creating better solutions that meet the need of senior living communities and their residents
And we're taking advantage of all of our enterprise assets, including CVS Pharmacy, our infusion properties and MinuteClinic
And we launched some new programs in these settings during 2016, we're piloting others in early 2017 and we'll have more on these programs in the coming quarters
Before turning to the front store, let me highlight our recent announcement on generic epinephrine
Given the urgent need in the marketplace for a less expensive epinephrine auto-injector for patients with life-threatening allergies, we partnered with Impax to purchase their product at a price lower than similar brand or authorized generic products
And we now have available at all CVS Pharmacy locations the authorized generic for Adrenaclick at a cash price of about $110, a price that's 80% lower than that of the brand competition in the market
And this move is consistent with the fact that increasing competition within therapeutic drug classes is a way to reduce the cost of prescription drugs, and we're using our capabilities and our scale to do just that
Turning to the front store business, comps decreased 2.9% as a result of softer customer traffic, combined with our continued focus on increasing personalization and rationalizing our promotional strategies
At the same time, front store gross margin once again improved in the quarter versus last year
And keep in mind that our front store business accounts for about 11% of our enterprise revenues, and these personalization efforts are allowing us to invest our promotional spend in a differentiated way producing margin flow-through
In fact, we have started to further reduce mass promotion in 2017 to better serve our loyal customers and continue driving profitable front store sales
We continue to focus on growing our beauty, healthcare and personal care businesses, and recognizing the growing presence in the digital market, we've been focused on enhancing our online capabilities to create an integrated health and pharmacy experience that only CVS can provide
CVS Curbside is now live in about 4,000 CVS Pharmacy stores and it provides a fast, seamless shopping experience with customers ordering products on their mobile devices and then picking them up at a CVS store without getting out of the car
We also introduced CVS Pay which allows customers to pick up prescriptions, use ExtraCare, pay for front store items, all with one scan of their CVS app
And this year, we plan to enhance our online shopping tool and further integrate personalization into digital platforms to increase engagement with health and beauty shoppers
We also continue to roll out store resets to improve our health and beauty leadership
Our focus is on scaling our healthy food selection and optimizing our key categories in the health quadrant and elevating our beauty offerings while improving shopability
And finally, Store Brands remain an area of strength and significant opportunity
Our Store Brands represented 23.7% of front store sales in the quarter and that's up about 160 basis points from the same quarter a year ago
Now, before turning it over to Dave for the financial review, I want to again acknowledge the near-term headwinds in the retail business this year given the unexpected network changes we highlighted late last year
And as previously outlined, we have a plan in place to return to more robust levels of earnings growth
And let me quickly summarize this four-point plan in response to the near-term market dynamics
First, we'll leverage our enterprise capabilities and CVS Pharmacy's compelling value proposition to partner more broadly with other PBMs and health plans to deliver the greatest overall healthcare value
And our partnership with Optum, which starts with a 90-day solution, is a great example and we look forward to discussing other long-term opportunities to bring together complementary capabilities that provide greater convenience and value for our clients and customers
We've begun to offer a menu of services to other PBMs and health plans as well, including exclusive capabilities such as MinuteClinic services, infusion and Long Term Care capabilities as a component of the CVS pharmacy value proposition
Second, we'll continue to innovate to bring new integrated PBM products to market that capitalize on the benefits inherent in our unique integrated model, while meeting the ongoing needs of our clients and members
Third, as we discussed on Analyst Day, we've begun work on a new multi-year enterprise streamlining initiative
And through these efforts, we expect to achieve nearly $3 billion in cumulative savings by 2021. And fourth, we have significant cash generation capabilities that provide us with a variety of ways to grow and return value to shareholders
And we remain confident that we can achieve solid operating profit growth across the enterprise in the years ahead
And our substantial cash flow affords us opportunities to bolster that growth, either through strategic acquisitions to supplement our existing asset base or through value-enhancing share repurchases
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review
Okay
Well, thanks, Dave
And we remain confident that we are well-positioned as the healthcare market continues to evolve
We continue to have the most extensive suite of integrated enterprise assets, and on a stand-alone basis each one would be market-leading
What really sets them apart lies in our ability in a large way through technology to integrate pharmacy care from the payer to the provider and ultimately to the patient
And these capabilities help us to deliver on our goal of driving more affordable, more accessible, and more effective care
So with that, let's go ahead and open it up for your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Well, Lisa, it's a great question
And, first of all, I think it is important that the story be told in a succinct and factual way, starting with the key policymakers and decision-makers, and that starts in D
And we've certainly been having those discussions in an effort to separate fact from fiction
And I think for the reasons that I alluded to in my prepared remarks there, we need to deal with this issue today
But the PBM industry has dealt with this issue in the past and has gone through a series of reviews, as I alluded to earlier, whether it was through the FTC, through Congressional Budget Office, other governmental agencies that have quantified not just the role that PBMs play, but the value that PBMs bring to the healthcare economy
And so, it is important that we start there
And at the same time, listen, we're having an awful lot of discussions with our clients
And as we talk about transparency with them, I do believe that they understand the role that we bring for them
And I think that in this environment where benefit plan designs continue to evolve and change, I think we're doing more to share with them what we see as best practices across the industry, especially as you think about the growth of consumer-directed health plans and what it means to provide the value of those rebates or discounts at the point of sale and what it means to have a preventive drug list, where there's zero out of pocket expense for their members
I just use those as two examples
So, Lisa, I don't think there's a single answer to that other than – which I think is where you were going – it really needs to be a surround-sound dialogue with a variety of constituents
Lisa, it's Larry again
I think when I hear you ask that question, you think about the rhetoric from those who are perhaps selling the drugs from those who are buying the drugs
And when you hear that, it gives me pause in terms of taking a step back and really asking the question, why are we in this position to begin with
And you look back and you think about just the sheer number of branded products that have come off patent over the last four, five years
We've got nearly $100 billion of branded drugs that have lost patent protection
Obviously, that's created somewhat of a headwind for the pharmaceutical industry
You've got new products that have entered the market that to some degree I describe as me-too products that are entering the market at inflated price points with no incremental effectiveness over the existing therapies
So why should sponsors of care pay for a higher price of those drugs, especially when many of those drugs are the ones that we're seeing advertised on TV, okay, countless times; and there's a cost to that
So I think when you start connecting the dots in terms of why the rhetoric now, what has changed in the marketplace that is driving this, it starts to bring some of that dialogue to the discussion
Lisa, I'll start, then I think Jon will want to jump in
But I think as we've talked many times, as we underwrite the business we underwrite it to an overall level of profitability, and there are many, many things – as we talked at Analyst Day, PBM tools that are utilized that create value for clients
So the answer to that would be no
There's many, many other things that we do that create value for our clients and their members
Let me start, then Helena will jump in
But, John, listen, when you look at the industry broadly, I do think that for many stakeholders across the supply chain the lines are blurry in terms of being competitors and at the same time being partners
And I think that everybody is kind of learning their way around that
There are many examples of that out in the marketplace
We shared some of those, beyond the example that you're alluding to, in terms of our CVS Pharmacy business
But you look at our Med D business where we have SilverScript and at the same time we're managing the Med D benefit for about 40 of our health plan clients
And we can show that while we're competing and at the same time partnering, the health plan growth for our clients has been faster than the market
So I think it's a great example of how we can create a win-win situation
And so, the answer to your question in terms of how broadly, quite frankly, it's with all the PBMs that we do business with
And I'll flip it over to Helena to talk in a little more detail about those conversations
Next question?
Good morning, Ross
Listen, it's a great question, and I think some of it goes back to the earlier point that I made that what can we do, how can we work with our clients on the PBM side in terms of best practices around plan design
Obviously, there's a completely different story for that consumer at the pharmacy counter if the rebate value is flowing through at the point-of-sale versus back to the client and the client reflecting that rebate value in some way, but it kind of gets diluted across the overall plan design benefit
And I think we obviously see that as a best practice amongst some other things that we can talk about there
And listen, I think some of the – you brought up epinephrine, and I think what we were able to do with Impax is a great example of what can happen when we can introduce more competition within a therapeutic class even though it may not be an A/B rated generic
And yes, it does require an intervention with their physician oftentimes
But I do believe that the medical community is becoming more sensitized to price being a variable around the quality and continuity of care
And by the way, we play that role at retail
And by the way, the PBM plays that role as well in the development of formularies
So, Ross, I think it's a complicated answer or question
It's an important question, and I think it'll continue to evolve
We're already doing things and we're working hard to do more in that regard
Well, Ross, listen, it's another great question
And I think I'll probably take us back a minute to Analyst Day where we showed all of the different I'll say assets that we operate
And the common denominator across those assets lies in the fact that we're delivering that last mile of care to the patient
And by the way, it doesn't matter where you're at in the health care supply chain
That becomes kind of the important conduit at the end of the day
So I think there is a growing awareness and a growing understanding of the role that that can play, especially as there are more demands on changing consumer behavior, okay? Quite frankly, it kind of goes back to your first question
So I think it's that
And it comes back to the other question that was asked that we've got to figure this out recognizing that the folks that we're having these discussions with oftentimes are competitors as well
So I think it starts with a recognition and an acknowledgment that in cracking the code around this, we can find the sweet spot and still be competitors, but at the same time be partners
And I think we have some success stories
We're looking forward to growing that list of success stories with those objectives in mind
And, Michael, it's Larry
I think the only point that I would add, and again it brings us back to the Analyst Day, but you may recall Alan Lotvin showed some examples of how using the pharmacy data, okay, we can provide a similar level of integration as one may be thinking about integrating medical and pharmacy benefits
And there's a lot of information and diagnostic information that can be ascertained simply doing a deeper dive in terms of the pharmacy information that we have
So we're looking to expand those capabilities, again, for the reasons that Jon acknowledged
Thanks, Steve
Yeah
And, Bob, it's Larry
Listen, I guess, I just want to emphasize Dave's comments, okay? Because I think what we have seen over the last several weeks is more pharmaceutical companies coming out with, I'll call it, their version of the social contract, if you will
And, as Dave mentioned, typically you see pricing activity occur in January; and we've seen similar levels of activity, but at a lower rate
So that's where it's coming from
And as Dave pointed out, I think the fact that we're not changing our profit guidance and objectives reflects the comments that we made last year as this question was coming up that modest changes in inflation really have no impact on the profitability of the enterprise business
Listen, I think it's a great question
And I think as we outlined in the prepared remarks that through the PBM lens we're working across the network to provide transparency across the pharmacy providers and providing education
And by the way, when all this rhetoric began, we went back and we took a look at, if you looked at the overall reimbursement rates year-over-year, from 2016 to 2015, okay, in an environment where we've talked about pharmacy margins being under a lot of reimbursement pressures, there are many, many pharmacies to include some specialty pharmacies, in the SilverScript network that their reimbursement rates in 2016 were more favorable than what they were in 2015, largely as the result of the performance network fees and the performance that they demonstrated around that
So I'm a little puzzled as to why all the rhetoric other than the fact that some people didn't get it right
Thanks, Bob
Bob, I'll flip your second question over to Helena
And, David, it's Larry
We also have some programs -- we've talked about these in the past -- on indication-based pricing which is a version of that
To some degree, that's largely in specialty
We're working with pharma in a different way, okay, based more on outcomes with the patient
Eric, It's Larry
I'll start, and then I think Jon will jump in
I think to a large degree those opportunities are more time-driven based on the current or existing contract, and it's going to end up tying back to the RFP process
And I would say that there continues to – we've talked a lot over the last year about insourcing, outsourcing and the fact that we continue to believe that we bring a lot of value to that equation, and that there is – makes a lot of sense
I think when the health plan mergers were being bantered about, there was some growing concern around that
And it looks like those are now in the rearview mirror
So we still continue to believe that we can bring value for smaller regional players
And, listen, we have a great relationship with Aetna, and we look forward to continuing to be a key partner with them and helping them to grow
Next question, please?
And, Ricky, if you look at the 40 million prescriptions on our base at retail, it's about a 3.5% impact, if you will
350 basis points, from a script perspective
Ricky, it's still pretty early around that
And keep in mind that health plans typically start a little earlier
So, quite frankly, some of the stuff that's starting to come in right now is really for January of 2019 because of their cycle
So as we've done in prior years, we'll have more to say on this on the first quarter call
We'll have a better idea of certainly the RFP activity consistent with prior years
Thanks, Ricky
Listen, I think we're all very pleased with not just standing up Red Oak, but the value that it's bringing to the supply chain
And I think as we've talked previously, the incremental year-over-year benefit obviously has slowed because we've got it up and running, but I think the Red Oak team continues to look for ways in which we can make the supply chain more efficient
And we're still looking and exploring those opportunities
So I think we're all very pleased with where we are today and where we're going with it
Yeah
I would say, Alvin, we haven't seen any material change and it' a competitive, but rational market as you just acknowledged
So, Nelson, we'll take one more question, please
Okay
So with that, I know it's been a long call, but hopefully we've provided a lot of information for you today and in light of some of the, I'll call them, current events in the marketplace
And we appreciate everyone's time
And as always, Nancy and Mike are available for any follow-ups you might have
Thanks, everyone
