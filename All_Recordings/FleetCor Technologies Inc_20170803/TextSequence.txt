Okay, Eric
Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining the call this afternoon
Upfront here, I'll plan to cover two subjects
First, I'll comment on our Q2 results and rest of year outlook, and second, I'll provide an update on some recent developments
So, on to the quarter
We reported very good Q2 results, generally consistent with our internal expectations
We reported revenue of $541 million, up 30%, and cash EPS of $199 million, up 26%
That's back-to-back quarters of profit growth above 25%
The macro overall was a nonfactor in our Q2 earnings
Fuel price and fuel spreads were a bit favorable, but FX interest rates and our tax rate were unfavorable versus the prior year
So, again, overall neutral macro against profits
Organic growth 9%, in Q2 with Fuel Card revenue growth of 8%
Revenue growth in our other four major product lines was double-digit; that excludes our All Other category
Same-store sales finally strengthened in Q2 to plus 1%
We had particular strength in lodging and corporate payments
Q2 sales grew 7% versus prior year, with two of our smaller international markets, Mexico and Russia, grew sales a 100% versus last year
Q2 cash flow expanded to $125 million, up 40% versus last year and up $70 million sequentially versus Q1 2017. Q2 global customer revenue retention was 91.5%, that's nine consecutive quarters of 90%-plus retention
So in terms of drivers for Q2, basically three things
One, STP made a big contribution, we didn't own that last year
It grew 14% on a pro forma basis, again 9% organic growth, about $40 million flowed through into earnings
And lastly, we had about 1 million fewer shares outstanding
I do want to point out that a few things did not go as well as we planned in Q2. The Comdata MasterCard portfolio that we converted in Q1 suffered some one-time losses in Q2 due to a bumpy IT conversion
Fortunately, the U.S
MasterCard portfolio that we didn't convert to a new platform continued to grow quite well, up 34% in the quarter
So the one we converted, not so good; the ones that we didn't convert still growing nicely
Our Comdata trucking money movement products, eCash and Comchek, quite soft in the quarter
We're moving to replace both of those with new, fresher versions
And STP was just a bit delayed in some of its pricing actions as we chose to test our way in a bit more slowly
But look, all in all a good solid quarter, good profit growth, and really kind of a good first half of 2017. Okay, let me transition over to the outlook for the rest of the year
Starting with the macro, so basically outlooking a neutral macro for the second half; FX will be better, interest rates will be worse, but on an overall basis neutral for rest of the year
Operating performance should be quite similar to Q2. Things that are going well will continue to go well
The couple of soft spots, the Comdata MasterCard portfolio that we converted and the Comdata money movement products probably soft still for the second half
But expected acceleration in our corporate payments business, they brought on a lot of new business that will get implemented in the second half that's been previously sold
And STP will gain on some of the pricing initiatives and some of the new channels, new sales channel initiatives in the second half
Speedway should be fully ramped by September heading into Q4, and we continue to roll out these PAC Pride extended network cards
So this set of positives should absorb a couple of the weaker spots that we mentioned
And then finally, we're expecting a rebalancing of our portfolio here in the second half, replacing our telematics business, NexTraq, with our international payments business, Cambridge
So obviously that trade should result in faster revenue growth next year
So these expectations result in the following 2017 guidance adjustment
We'll raise full-year 2017 cash EPS guidance $0.03 from $8.31 to $8.34 at the midpoint
So that reflects the $0.03 beat here in Q2, effectively leaving our rest of year guidance unchanged
This guidance assumes the portfolio rebalancing I mentioned, NexTraq out, Cambridge in; that will be about $0.03 unfavorable in the second half, but that will be offset by the ASR, which will be $0.03 favorable in the second half
Our second half organic growth overall should pencil out at around 8% or 9%, with slower fuel card growth in the second half, again due to that bumpy MasterCard conversion
Okay, let me shift gears and talk about some recent developments
So first up on the capital allocation front, we announced we just refinanced our term debt facility, increasing our liquidity and extending our maturity, so we raised another $700 million in term debt – favorable rates, the term A and revolver staying put at L175, the term B rate improving 25 bps to L plus 200, term A revolver maturity extended five years and the B seven years
And that raise was oversubscribed
We also completed our telematics NexTraq sale to Michelin for $320 million in July, so we now have that cash
So basically this new raise and sale gives us the available liquidity to close and fund Cambridge, fund a $250 million ASR, potentially do more open-market share buybacks or acquisitions going forward
And looks like it will leave our pro forma leverage ratio at year-end at under three times our target
On the partner relationship front, some good progress this quarter
We're delighted to announce that Uber has extended their relationship with us
So, happy to continue to grow that program with them
Speedway, we progressed the implementation quite nicely, now 75% complete, expected to finish in September
That will lift revenues in Q4 and into next year, so that conversion going well
And we've also gotten closer to some decisions on some new international partner opportunities, so hopeful that a couple of things there will come to conclusion
On the acquisition front, Cambridge, expect to close Cambridge by September 1. We've now received regulatory clearance
We've received approvals and waivers/or for all the necessary state money transmitter licenses
We finalized our Year One transformation integration plan and appointed one of our executives to lead the transformation effort
Cambridge is out looking 20% plus revenue growth in calendar 2017. You may have seen the SVS announcement, we have decided mutually with First Data to terminate our gift card JV
The, challenge timeline and cost associated with the regulatory process is what led us to reconsider the decision and move forward independently, retaining SVS
We're in the process now of reworking our growth plan for SVS and we'll revert with those thoughts and ideas later this year
STP, hard to believe, but coming up on our one-year anniversary of that acquisition, business performing well
Low teens revenue growth in the first half, many of our transformational initiatives now taking hold, some pricing, lower credit losses, traction on some new sales channels, and testing of a new revamped IT system
So, quite pleased so far with STP and its prospects
In terms of pipeline, we are still active, working some new potential acquisitions, specifically a couple attractive tuck-ins, so we'll keep you posted as we get closer there
Let me give you an update on system conversion or migrations, we've worked on three IT conversions in the first half of 2017. Two have gone well or very well, and one has gone not so well
So on the good news front, we did convert our Comdata processing mainframe infrastructure from running in the Comdata office building to running on the IBM Cloud
This is good, it's – it helps in terms of processing speeds, it'll lower our IT costs going forward and it gives us better disaster recovery if we should ever need it
Second conversion, I mentioned earlier Speedway, we've converted 75% of that portfolio to FleetCor systems
The conversion has gone well, quite well, and again, expect to wrap that up in Q3. On the not so good front, we converted a portion, one of our direct MasterCard portfolios off of the Comdata mainframe in Q1. We had problems converting the history or client balances
That led to several weeks of delays in billing, some errors in billing, unfortunately long wait times in customer service
And as a result, we've seen a number of clients leave the program in Q2 because of those bumpy IT issues
Fortunately, we've now corrected those conversion issues, the service is running normally again, and client attrition seems to have plateaued, so we're back at trying to rebuild that portfolio
So, look, in conclusion again a good Q2, good growth, 26% profit growth, back-to-back quarters of 25%-plus profit growth
Basically, a neutral macro environment here in Q2 and previously in Q1. And overall, we're outlooking basically a neutral environment rest of the year, so glad to be off that subject
Our second half outlook is up sequentially, expecting 20% profit growth for full-year 2017. We're rebalancing the portfolio to faster growth businesses; NexTraq out, Cambridge in; we're strengthening our capital base, returning capital to shareholders, still increasing our liquidity and still maintaining a less-than-three-times leverage ratio
Still on the hunt for some new partner deals, and have extended our relationship with Uber, and we feel like we're past the distractions of the first half and getting back to work, back to business
So net-net we feel pretty well positioned to finish the rest of 2017 strong and take some of that momentum into 2018. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Eric
Yeah, Ramsey
So kind of first half, I think I said low teens, I think the second half will be closer to high teens to 20%, and I'd say we would stay at that level probably at least the first six months of next year, and then probably mid-to-high-teens
So the short answer is, it's just more term
They're happy, we're happy, so they added more term to the existing deal
We're still trying to figure out how to take the program internationally, so that's still a work in process
Thanks
Hey, David
Which is the direct, you're saying direct MasterCard?
Yeah, I don't have it handy
I think what we quoted is our collective set of U.S
MasterCard products
I think it was a combo of the one we converted, which went a bit into the ditch, and the ones we didn't grew 34%
I think the combination of all of those was plus 17%, the happy stuff that didn't convert and the sad stuff that converted, I think the consolidated number was 17%
Well again, I would say, per my comments, likely down, right? I tried to be as transparent as possible that we took a bit of a divot in this conversion
We did the conversion and it took a while to get a read on it, and basically the read of what we converted was not great
So we'll see obviously more of that as we go into kind of Q3 and Q4. So that particular portfolio will probably be flat over the next couple of quarters, and the other five or six MasterCard portfolios we would expect will continue growing at a pretty – at a 20-percent-plus rate
So that's – so I'd say, it's still unclear David, what the shape of that particular file that we converted, but we forecasted it to be kind of flat, the next couple of quarters
Again, as you know, it's across of a lot of places, but I'd say the Brazil thing got better, the employment piece – at least the line of business we're in, the transport piece, got significantly better
The lodging piece, which I think we had on our to-do sheet (39:13) a year or so ago is in the rear-view mirror, those things are now back to positive
The corporate payments business was quite healthy, the base
So I think it's, again, when we did this consolidated number
I think it was a point or point and half negative
It's four or five pieces, David, moving in the right direction that brings kind of the total from minus one to plus one
So it's not one thing
It's literally probably four or five things that went a bit our way this quarter
When you say the large, clarify the question that – when you say the large?
Let me look; I've got the sales number, I think, handy here
I don't have the revenue number, but I do have the sales number handy
Sales were up about 20% combined, for the old Comdata business, fleet business, over the prior year
That's up 100% basically over two years ago, when we started the expansion of people
So that productivity is obviously getting healthy now, and obviously way up from when we bought the thing
But we have completed them, David, they are complete
And I think we reiterated what we said before, that our view, management's view is we are in compliance with every law that regulates our business
Always a pleasure
2% to 3%, Ashish, in Q2.
And the fuel card would have been 11% instead of 8%
So when we gave you 10% for calendar 2017, we didn't expect to have an IT divot, and it started in the second quarter, so
Yeah
It's been a long saga for you guys as well, so I'd say that we obviously considered some other alternatives right, prior to entering into the deal with First Data, and B, we've gotten a bit smarter, we've now owned it, whatever, two-plus years
So we're going to go back – the guy running that's a very good guy
We're going to go back basically and dust off some of the other options and dust off his three-year growth plan, which we reviewed a bit ago, and come back to you guys, probably next call, with some clearer view of what we're going to do
Yeah
I mean, the business is performing great, sales in that line of business were up 35% in the quarter, and I think we told you they were up 50% the prior year, over the first year
So, the sales are good, and that conversion time is about 12 months to 18 months, so it's relatively easy for us to plan what the second half of next year is going to look like, because we fundamentally have sold virtually all the business as of today that will hit revenue in the second half and in 2018. And so, again, that business is trending, I think, 14% – 13%, 14%, 15% this quarter, it'll step-up a bit, so it's great
And then obviously on top of that we have the Cambridge thing that we expect to close this month, and that gives us some great cross-sale opportunity, some ripe accounts to deliver those same domestic AB (45:25) products into
So we've grown to like that business a lot
So, I'd say, Bob, the goal is still in fact, in our forecast, it's either high teens or actually hitting 20% as we exit
So to your point, we're resegmenting the higher value people, and then we've got some different sales channels that will also bring in some higher value people, and then we've got a longer range plan where some of those new toll roads are expected to come on line
And so the business is fighting just a general malaise in the economy, and particularly in the trucking sector, which is a big part of the transaction
So that's one of the places that same-store sales are still quite soft, which is bringing the tran count down
But again, we don't – today the company doesn't get paid very much from that group, so it's not as big an impact on revenue
But I'd say that we're well along on a bunch of these plans, the repricing plans, the new sales channel, the IT stuff to enable some of it, the toll road thing is legislated, so I'd say our confidence is still quite high that that's close to 20% business in the mid-term
Yeah
Our – we keep track of both credit losses in total and fraud as a piece of our credit losses, and fraud has declined 2016 over 2015, and this year year-to-date versus the per year
So our fraud is down
But we've gone crazy, Bob, in terms of what we call dragnet authorization, controls basically to find, identify and shut off fraudulent stuff, because we had our own share of problems four and five years ago
So I'd say that we've worked that pretty hard, and year-to-date, I think our total fraud losses are in the $4 million, $5 million range, so it seems pretty low
Oh, year-to-date – annualized, call it $5 million
You can only work on so many things, so that's one we worked on, yes
I have it – I have it here in front of me
Yeah, $5 million to $10 million favorable in the second half
Hey, Tien-Tsin
I'd say in our forecast, we reported 7% global sales growth over the prior year
I would say 10% to 12% would be the number if we hadn't gotten distracted, right, calling customers back for this thing
So I would assume that that will rebound, will be double-digit growth of sales in the second half
And we haven't done all the math yet, there will be some flow-through from this one-time attrition, so one portfolio, which I think, Eric, was 3% to 4% of the global company was the file we converted? So, anyway whatever that one-time loss is, we'll see some of that trickle into Q3 and Q4, that 91.5%
But again, that's in our – kind of in the numbers, which I don't want to make this a depressing call talking about IT, but just to remind everybody, it clearly suggests rest of world, rest of three quarters, doing good to be able to continue to kind of beat what we set out and beat the profit number
It means kind of all the things we didn't convert are doing well
Well, Jim, always – I've been wrong enough on this that it's hard to handicap again, but the update I try to provide is that the timeline to a decision that gets reported back to us has narrowed considerably
So, we expect in both cases to hear something imminently
And I'd say, like always, we're optimists, we like our chances
So we continue to tell you that we're in the hunt for things or people looking at them, people studying them, and people telling us they're going to decide, and so we're kind of reporting back that we expect to hear something soon
Yeah
I think the visibility we have is limited, right? We would have called out that we see the thing turning
What I would say is the few industries that are clear, right? We've grown over the oil and gas thing, same thing on the transport, lodging, business, the railroad thing, we're on the other side of that
It looks like again the Brazil thing is stable to move a bit
So I'd say that it feels like a few of the pieces that were on the wrong side of this thing have moved to the correct side
But with as many different places and things we're in, and I can't say that we have a great forward view of it
We kind of planned it flat, is kind of what's in our forecast for the second half
