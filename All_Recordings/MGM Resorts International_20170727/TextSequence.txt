Well, thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone
We're quite proud of the results we've reported this morning, and I think it's a tribute to what we've discussed many times before in terms of our focus on margin, profitability and the very hard work of the men and women that have brought incredible operational efficiencies to this organization
As you know, our cash flows rose in the quarter, and on a hold-adjusted basis, EBITDA would have been up 10%
We've guided you, when we talked about the second quarter, to lower gaming revenue, higher non-gaming revenue, and margins that would be up slightly
We met that guidance and in fact, did better than we expected in terms of profitability and margin as a result of our initiatives
Our margins grew 82 basis points to just over 31% and that was despite the fact that we were down almost 5 percentage points year-over-year in table games hold
On a hold-adjusted basis, as I said cash flows would have been up about 10%, and our margins would have been up over 200 basis points on The Strip alone
CityCenter had another outstanding quarter
Its revenues and cash flows grew 10% and 36% respectively, and our focus on margin has driven our operational efficiencies in every single department in which this company operates
We have achieved this despite the fact that we're investing in the future
As you know, we're dramatically transforming MGM's Monte Carlo property into Park MGM, that's been disruptive and will remain so throughout this year, and despite that, we're very comfortable where we see the Street in terms of earnings for the year
Regionally, our properties continued to do dramatically outperform their competitors
MGM Detroit had an all-time record in terms of revenue and EBITDA
National Harbor is already the market leader in Maryland and of course Borgata continues to perform at an outstanding rate, and that is a tribute to Tom Ballance, retiring today from Borgata and moving into corporate, and the rest of the great team at Borgata
Obviously, the results in Macau as a market have been impressive, we are anxiously awaiting the opening of Cotai that will help us dramatically
That resort opens in a couple of months
Grant will talk more about it
But suffice to say that it would help not only drive more business to our MGM property on the Peninsula, but we believe it will be very dynamic and it's very successful in Cotai
We've had a very strong year this year in Las Vegas, both in the first and in the second quarter
We just had another record at McCarran Airport in June, and the company has focused on maximizing the opportunities that are in front of us
And that means maximizing the revenue per occupied room in all of our resorts
That is the reason why our margins were up more than we expected
It's also the reason why RevPAR was below what our guidance was, as we consciously moved some occupancy away from higher ADR, but lower revenue per total occupied room into different channels, which resulted as you can see in higher profitability and higher margin, we expect that going forward
We see a very good third quarter underway
We have many challenges in the quarter because of a huge citywide convention quarter last year, and we held very well as we indicated in the third quarter of 2016, but despite that because we have an epic fight coming up in a couple of weeks and because we have good business on the books, we expect to see profitability increase again and margins also increase again
We believe that going forward, that the second half of the year will remain strong and that we will continue to be able to improve our profitability and margins, and in fact we are raising our margin guidance from what we have said earlier because we see more opportunities to increase margin going forward, already the industry-leading margin and certainly here in Las Vegas
This could be the second biggest fight of all time and it will certainly drive millions of people to watch Las Vegas, watch T-Mobile, and watch Mayweather and McGregor
We intend to maximize every $0.01 of profitability opportunity there and we're working very hard to accomplish that
I think we will be very successful
We've a lot to look forward to in the second half of the year, not only the opening of Cotai in the fourth quarter but the improvements that we're taking to all of our operations, which we see as accelerating our margin
We're running this company for cash flow and if that has not been clear in the past, certainly was in this quarter and we will continue to do so going forward because we believe that's the best way to drive value to our shareholders and we intend to continue to be competitive in the marketplace when we find opportunities on the horizon and I think the opportunity currently on the horizon is Japan where I would say that we are one of the leaders in terms of contenders in that marketplace
I have to say that I'm proud of what we've done
But I believe that our best days are ahead of us and what we see today is more confidence in our business than we've seen in the last ten years
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator, so we get to your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Sure Joe, it's almost exclusively business decisions that we're making here
It does not reflect at all the health of the market and certainly does not reflect our perspective of the market in the second half of the year
When we started PGP, we were focused on many of the non-hotel areas where we could drive margin profitability, not only in terms of table games margins and overall casino margins, but in our non-gaming areas in terms of driving margin there
The hotel divisions of many of these resorts including ours have been run more independently and have been focused on driving RevPAR
We know that that's not the right approach in a casino hotel environment
That's not how you drive profitability
No one here in this room that I'm aware of is bonused on RevPAR
We're bonused on profits
We made a decision when we moved from PGP to continuous improvement to dig in more on our hotel yielding and do it more holistically
We actually started that in the beginning of the year
It had a minimal impact on the first quarter, because we had such a strong convention calendar in the first quarter
It had more of an impact in terms of RevPAR in the second quarter, but we drove more profitability throughout the resorts in the second quarter
That's why revenue per occupied room in the second quarter was actually up over 5%
That's the important metric
In terms of looking forward, we feel very strongly, and we know this business pretty well, the way to drive increased margin and increased profitability is the yield total resort from a standpoint of driving revenue into the resort, and that will have a dampening impact on RevPAR, and that's okay because we're trying to drive more profits
The only macro point I would say in the quarter was a little bit of a weakness, a little bit of softness in the early part of June
It was literally like a two-week period of time, and it bounced back right at the end of the month
But really that had minimal impact, and also we probably underestimated the impact of the disruption at Monte Carlo a little bit, but these are just fringe things, it's not the overall point
I think the overall point is, on RevPAR as we're talking about it, a 1% difference in RevPAR
So in other words, instead of if we did 2.2% instead of 1.2% for our portfolio
A 1% delta is only $2 million of profit
A 1% increase in our margin just on The Strip is $14 million
We made a decision which we'll continue to make to focus on profitability and margin, and that really was the total story in terms of RevPAR in the second quarter, and the reason why we want people to be more focused on this in the third and fourth quarters
We're going to have a good third quarter, very strong despite the big city-wides that we saw last year and a 10% increase in RevPAR that we had last year
And we're going to have that because of a Mayweather-McGregor fight, a GGG-Canelo fight and some good convention business
But more importantly, I think we're going to be able to drive margins in the third quarter more than we had predicted when we began the year
Grant, could you tackle that?
So just adjust just for Monte Carlo, RevPAR would have been 1.8%
No
No, we had predicted what we have in terms of resort fees in that number and in our prior guidance
Really the difference is Monte Carlo being a little tougher than we thought and a very short period of time in June
But I really want to emphasize the fact that we're moving away in Micah's team and our hotel yield team away from focusing on maximizing RevPAR
We've all known about this, both the sell-side, the buy-side, us at management, that that's not really the best way of running our business
But we didn't have the tools frankly, Felicia, earlier in our process until this year in terms of analytics, in terms of intelligence to yield these resorts in a more holistic way
And that's a manifestation of continuous improvement
We have people doing this now that we didn't have before, hired from other companies
And it will have a impact on total revenue per occupied room in a very positive way, we think
On the business side, Felicia, we see convention partners changing somewhat their convention practices
For example, some of the larger companies are consolidating some conventions
They might have five in a given year of a certain size and they're consolidating them down to three or four
That has some kind of volatility around some of the convention markets around the United States, and I think, a little bit to a lesser extent here in Las Vegas, but we've seen that trend occurring
The reality to that is they're actually driving a lot more delegates per convention obviously, as they consolidate the number of conventions
So, we see bigger spikes in convention attendance rather than what we had seen before
As an example, we literally last week just finished Microsoft
They were in here, it was amazing for better part of a week
That's a convention as you know, we didn't have last July, and it was highly successful for us
So, I think the only – and I'll turn it over to others if they see anything differently, but the only thing we see a little bit differently is how companies are handling their convention business
Every other segment – and by the way, we're still going to be up in conventions, and we're still doing extremely well
And Las Vegas, I think is the beneficiary of this, because we're a better value destination
Every other segment is up: leisure for us, will drive you more people for our own channels, which is more profitable to us, our FIT business, the casino was very strong, and that's why total revenue per occupied room was up nicely in the quarter
I'll turn it over to Corey for that
Yeah, I'd just add to that part, Corey
Obviously, we are well aware of the CRM softwares that are out there, salesforce
com being one that Caesars is using, and other companies have different techniques
We have our own CRM
It's going to evolve and one of the things that has been a benefit of the Borgata acquisition has been – they've had a very strong CRM process in place at Borgata
And we're taking that learning, and Tom Ballance, who is now in corporate with us, is leading the team with Anton Nikodemus and a variety of our best leaders here, including Marcus Glover, who is going to be running Borgata to make it a company-wide decision on improving analytics, and artificial intelligences and CRM
But that's exactly what Corey is referring to by changing the channels on the non-gaming side this year, and being able to do more process, marketing on the gaming side
We've been able to increase our revenue per occupied room, which is why you see a really good slot handle, and you see good table volume, it would have been more evident if we had just held normally, but even with lower hold, it benefited us
So thank you
It's a good way to kind of step back and look at what we're trying to accomplish here
One is obviously to drive free cash flow and I will get into that more
But certainly, we're accelerating our free cash flow generation in our operations this year versus last and we think next year significantly more
But adding to free cash flow comes the other levers that we have
One of the major levers that we have is MGP
We were really clear when we brought MGP public a couple Aprils ago that National Harbor which has a ROFO, it would be an asset that we would like to transact with, with MGP
We also said that we'd like to have a few quarters under National Harbor's belt before we entered into those negotiations
Well, we have a few quarters under our belt right now, so I would think that it would be logical to assume that a transaction would be more in the near term than the long term between MGM and MGP
That, if done properly, and we expect it would if we do it, would have a profoundly positive impact on MGM Resorts in terms of its liquidity and its cash and squarely fits with the overall arching belief that we need to return cash to our shareholders
MGP is out on the prowl on a variety of other transactions, some of which will not involve MGM, but others very likely could
And recall that we're opening up Springfield, Massachusetts, next year, I think in September or August and that obviously is a candidate for MGP as well
The other lever that we have is clearly through asset sales
There has been a significant level of interest on The Strip right now
There is really strong chatter around the Fontainebleau being sold with a hotel flag that will be put on it
We're not involved, to be clear
But that would be a good sign for the market, if people are willing to invest a lot of money to try to bring that property to life
And we own assets as well
We own Circus Circus
We own the Mandarin at CityCenter and several other assets that we always look to find out what we should do in terms of our best interests
In terms of other levers that we have, clearly CityCenter itself with another record quarter is generating a significant amount of cash
We will continue to return that cash to its shareholders, Infinity World and MGM
And of course, once we open up in Cotai, MGM China should turn into a significant free cash flow generator beginning next year
So, the levers that we have in front of us that we're constantly trying to maximize are number one, free cash because our CapEx is going to roll over and be very minimal going forward; two, asset sales or other ways of monetizing assets; three, dividends from our ventures
That's a good question that hasn't been asked of us before
But yes, I feel like if there is – I got to talk to our board about this – but if there is a significant one-time event that would generate a tremendous amount of cash to MGM Resorts, that would impact our decision making versus free cash flow that is steadily and rapidly growing
And yes, we've been very clear on capital allocation and shareholder returns
We started with dividends, quarterly dividends
We expect that we'll be able to increase our quarterly dividend over time
But that share repurchase also will be part of our discussion at the board level
And if we have a significant windfall, which I think we will, one or two of them, over the next couple years, we'd be more immediate in our transferring that windfall to shareholders than rapidly growing free cash flow
Thank you
Yeah, and I think maybe, I don't want to cut you off, Dan, but I think that that's exactly right
Because our convention mix is growing and becoming more profitable to us and because we see a strong convention calendar in 2018 and 2019, and because we're expanding our convention facilities right now at Aria and at MGM, and you weave that together with the expansion already at Mandalay that sets up a much stronger foundation for us to look at the rest of our rooms
From the rest of our rooms' perspective, we're becoming more intelligent about how we can shift leisure into transient
And that requires software that we're deploying
It requires a different philosophy which we're also deploying, but it also is as a result of the fact that we're more confident in our overall occupancies than before
And that's I guess the point that should be always made is that all of us out here, our competitors and ourselves, run these resorts at mid 90s occupancy
That's why RevPARs is so misleading
It's not about occupying the buildings
It's about occupying the buildings in a way that will generate the most profit to the resorts, not just to the hotel department of the resorts
The combination of this and the loyalty CRM marketing that's going to have an impact – increasing impact on the casino side is going to provide a revenue and profit growth that we did not anticipate when we started this about a year ago
I guess three years, 2.5 half years is the earliest, but I would say three years
And I guess the point I'd make
I love this town
We don't have as many rumors in Las Vegas as Macau, but we do hold our own that it would be more hotel centric than anything else
And obviously, up near a expanding and upgraded convention center, that would be very positive for the town and positive for Northern properties like Mirage and Circus Circus, of course
And I think that knowing what we know about our own portfolio, the level of interest we're getting on assets that are not already owned by MGP is very high
And we're a transactional company, and so I do expect that there will be opportunities, like we did with Crystals opportunistically to sell that asset at very attractive cap rate, I think there'll be other opportunities to monetize without changing the overall trajectory of what we're trying to accomplish here
Yeah, I mean that's obviously yes
One, I think we should start talking about Aria as part of our family more
I mean people look at Aria is like a separate than the rest of our portfolio
But we run Aria as we run any other property in terms of moving a business around and having customers make their decision
So that I think Cathy's point is a good one
But we anticipated a tough comp
That's why we had said in the second quarter that our gaming revenue is like going to down
We didn't anticipate 500 basis-point decrease in hold year-over-year
But we're going to have a tremendous amount of gaming volume coming in, in August
If people don't understand the impact on fights and this is not just a fight but a spectacle, just kind of watch TV
We've had a lot of people that said we're coming in August that did not come in June or July
They're coming in August and that will help
So I think that our feeling about gaming volumes here in town in terms of our own and our competitors is quite solid, particularly on the Far East side
And the standpoint of looking at what drivers that are events, and to have two fights in one quarter is something we've never had before
So we're hopeful that that has a gaming impact that we could be proud of
I'll start and then anyone can jump in
One is our convention business looks like it will be at least as good, if it not better, in '18 versus '17. That's the base that I was referring to, and it's the manifestation of some conventions that I was alluding to before that have shifted from '17 into '18 as some of the big companies have consolidated some of their convention business
That's going to actually help us in '18. That's the first point
Second point is we'll have the benefit of the expansions of our conference facilities at Aria and emerging at MGM
That certainly helps captures much of the incremental business as we can
Thirdly, we're converting Monte Carlo, which has been at our lower end of our RevPAR, our ADR spectrum into Park MGM and NoMad, which will be at the upper end of our ADR spectrum in our portfolio
That will have a very, I think, nice impact not only on that resort but the neighborhood and we own the neighborhood
And so driving higher ADRs in New York, New York, driving better mix throughout that campus will be effective
The third, I would not ignore the fact that we're having our first professional sports team start in a couple months
The Golden Knights will be playing later this year throughout early '18, which sets up for very strong sports calendars that we expect to have in '18 and beyond, increasing sporting events to Las Vegas, whether it's more college, and/or more pros will have a big impact on the market
And we should do better than most on that
The airlines are – they're talking positively about '18 in terms of coming into McCarran, and the convention center itself, the Las Vegas Convention Center is also talking about a better year
So those are some of the macros that I know
I don't if you have any others?
That was a good point, Corey
Anything else, Dan, on that?
50 basis points to 100 basis points
And I think we always will, Dan
I mean I think the point that we've made to folks is that when you own 42,000 hotel rooms here and you're driving this business for cash flow and to try to increase revenues going forward, you're going to, within the CapEx contours that we've stated, which we would reaffirm, we're able to reposition properties within a couple year period of time as we straddle years in terms of CapEx to dramatically increase profitability
It does have an impact in the near term at the property itself, like it is at Monte Carlo, but we have the benefit of having 10 resorts out here
And so we feel like we can drive revenue, margin growth, profitability even when one property is undergoing this type of transformation
And it won't be the last one we do
If we are successful in converting Monte Carlo to Park MGM as we expect and get the kind of returns on investment that are going to be outsized relative to other investments that we can make, we'll look at another property to tackle in the out years
And so I think that's part of portfolio management in terms of trying to drive revenue, profitability, and long-term growth while you are focusing on free cash
There are a bunch in there
We can all jump in in different ones
One is, we usually don't borrow conventions, we steal and keep them
And I think it unlikely that we'll lose anything back to the Moscone Center
In fact, we haven't so far
So, we'll see
But once people get here and they see the value proposition, and they see the delegation attendance up 20%, 30% versus the other host city, they tend to only, generally do not leave, but we'll see
The 19% reflects the fact CON/AGG is not here next year, so actually that we would say would be a very good outcome for our company and it's not the ceiling to it, it's just what our projection is at this point in time because of what we see on the books and the fact, we're expanding our convention facilities
You want to take the RevPAR one Corey or Dan?
And so the ADR, I mean, the RevPAR connection between RevPAR, what Robin was asking and profitability, you want to explain that? I mean, it's the margin on the incremental non-gaming room is higher because of our channel shift
And also these customers, not only gaming, but these customers spend a lot more money in entertainment, whether it's in our nightlife or food and beverage, our shows in general
They're becoming more sports oriented which is a focus of ours, event driven, park theater, so it's not only improving the gaming side without having – our comp levels haven't changed by the way, Robin, on that point, but it's improving our non-gaming non-hotel revenue
It depends on who won
I'll start, maybe Grant, if in case Grant is asleep
We have not made our
Okay
We've not made our submission yet in terms of tables
That is something you do towards the end of the process
We have focused a lot and you can see it on in our investor deck on the nongaming components to COTAI, which we believe are transformational in that market
It's very unique, particularly on the entertainment side, which we are noted for
All that plays into the government's decision around table allocations and we're going to do the best we can on that and based on what we get, Grant will decide how to move tables around
Chad Beynon - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc
Thanks very much, Jim
You're welcome
So I just like to wrap up and say thank you for joining us
I'm proud of the effort in the second quarter in terms of executing on our plan
We're excited about the current quarter, having the second biggest fight of all time, it's a kind of fun
I'm excited about how in shape Mayweather is, I saw him in his gym a couple of nights ago, and I'm excited about what we have happening in the second half of the year
We're very clear on our direction here at the company in terms of maximizing our free cash flow, our capital expenditures are defined and declining and are unchanged from what we discussed with our community several times
We believe that results in significant growth in free cash and we intend to return that free cash to our shareholders
We have multiple levers ahead of us and some of them are imminent and that will enhance the overall return on capital to our shareholders as it relates to transactions that we talked about today
National Harbor couldn't be doing better from our perspective and is perfectly positioned to ultimately be owned by MGP
CityCenter is performing at an outstanding level, and also, is well-positioned to return more capital to its owners and perhaps provide more asset opportunities in terms of disposition
Macau is right around the corner in terms of the opening of COTAI and the impact of having such a beautiful property that we think will be very successful, the impact that will have to the MGM China shareholders
We will continue to build the company for the long-term but continue to reward our shareholders throughout this journey, and we will do so in the ways that have articulated
And I think that that will increase the value of the enterprise significantly over time
And with that, I'd like say thank you very much for joining us today
We're excited about the back half of the year and into 2018 and beyond
And as always, we're ready to take any of your questions
So, please give us a call
