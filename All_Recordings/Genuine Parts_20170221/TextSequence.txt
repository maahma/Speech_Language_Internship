Thank you, Sid, and let me add my welcome to all of you on the call this morning
We appreciate you taking the time to be with us
Earlier today, we released our fourth quarter and year end 2016 results
I'll make a few remarks on our overall performance, and then cover the highlights by business
Carol Yancey, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will provide an update on our financial results and our guidance for 2017. After that, we'll open the call to your questions
For some perspective on our performance, total sales in the fourth quarter were up 2.7% to $3.78 billion, while net income was $152.5 million and earnings per share was $1.02 compared to $1.07 in the fourth quarter of 2015. For the year, total sales were $15.34 billion, which is up slightly, with net income at $687 million and earnings per share at $4.59 compared to $4.63 in 2015. These results represent the total sales and earnings across our Automotive, Industrial, Office and Electrical operations, which we'll discuss in more detail throughout this call
We executed on many of our initiatives in 2016, and we believe we entered the new year as a stronger, more diversified global distributor
And while there is no question the U.S
sales environment was challenging throughout the year, our international operations in Canada, Mexico and Australasia, outperformed the stronger, more positive results
In addition, we continue to build on the revenue and cost benefits derived from the growing scale associated with our portfolio of distribution operations, and we remain committed to further optimizing our enhanced buying power for indirect and direct spend
Together with the shared talent, best practices, transportation, technology, systems and common distribution processes, we expect to derive improved efficiencies, productivity and lower overall cost structure, which would ultimately drive profitability and add value to our end customers
During the past year, we utilized our strong balance sheet to further strengthen the company and generate cash flow
Although we cannot control the weather or the ongoing downturn in the energy sector, we remain focused on our long-term growth targets
This included ongoing investment in our core business and targeted complementary acquisitions that contributed to our performance in 2016 and will continue to enhance our results as we move forward
We have a proven track record as a disciplined and successful acquirer, and acquisitions remain an important element of our growth strategy
In 2016, we invested more than $400 million of capital for 19 new businesses, with estimated annual revenues of more than $600 million
Turning now to more details on our performance by six business segments
We'll begin with our Automotive operations, which were 53% of our total revenues in 2016. For the fourth quarter ending December 31, our global Automotive sales were up 2.4%, improved from the 1.5% increase in the third quarter and our strongest quarterly performance of the year
Comparable sales were up approximately 1%, which has improved from the prior two quarters
For the full year, global Automotive sales were up 1.2%
In the U.S
, which represents over 70% of our total Automotive revenues, sales were up slightly in the fourth quarter and improved from the low single-digit declines we experienced in the second and third quarters
This includes essentially flat comparable sales, which we believe is the most meaningful metric in measuring our core U.S
Automotive sales performance
This metric covers 100% of our revenue stream, and over time it will replace any reference to just our U.S
company-owned stores, which represent only one-third of our total U.S
Automotive sales and just over one-quarter of global Automotive sales
With that said, as we make this transition, we also want to be consistent in our quarterly reporting for 2016. So for your reference, U.S
company-owned same-store sales increased 0.5%, and for the full year we're slightly positive
Now turning back to our total U.S
result, the slight increase in fourth quarter sales was driven by a stronger December, and equally positive contributions from our commercial and retail platforms
Our commercial growth in the fourth quarter was driven by sales to our NAPA AutoCare Center customers, which grew to 17,200 members in 2016, an increase of nearly 500 members from 2015. This growth area was offset by slight sales declines to our major accounts and fleet customers, which experienced weaker demand patterns throughout most of 2016. We believe our DIY or retail sales growth in the fourth quarter was at least partially due to December's turn in the weather, which drove increased demand for cold weather parts, like batteries, starters, and heating and cooling products
Our nationwide NAPA Rewards program has now grown to more than 3 million members, and we believe we are seeing the benefit of that as well
Lastly, as part of our retail impact initiative, we rolled out 166 updated retail concept stores in 2016, exceeding our goal of 150. As a reminder, this initiative includes things like installing all-new interior layouts and graphics, extending store hours, and increasing training for our store associates
Although small on the overall scheme of total sales today, these updated stores continue to produce low double-digit retail sales growth
This steady uptick in sales gives us confidence in the long-term positive benefits of this initiative and we are on plan to accelerate the project with an additional 300 stores in 2017. Now moving on to the trends we are seeing across the U.S
Automotive aftermarket
The fundamental drivers for our business remain sound
The size of the vehicle fleet continues to grow
The average age of the fleet remains in excess of 11.5 years
Lower fuel prices remained favorable for the consumer, and miles driven continues to post substantial gains
Miles driven increased 4.3% in November, the most recent data available, and is up 3% for the 11 months
November marked 33 consecutive months of increases in miles driven, with lower fuel prices continuing to drive this key metric
The national average price of gasoline was $2.34 in the fourth quarter and just $2.25 for the full year; positive indicators for further increases in miles driven, and ultimately driving additional parts purchases in 2017. So now let's turn to our international Automotive businesses in Australasia, Canada and Mexico
Combined, these operations account for nearly 30% of our global Automotive revenues and, as we mentioned earlier, these operations outperformed with an 8% local currency increase in the fourth quarter and for the year
In Australia and New Zealand, fourth quarter sales improved by low double digit, driven by solid comparable sales growth, as well as the benefit of acquisitions
In total, the Asia-Pac business expanded their footprint with 52 new stores in 2016, and we see opportunities for further expansion in the future
We are also encouraged by the generally favorable economic conditions in this region, as well as solid fundamentals, such as a growing car park driven by record car sales, relatively low gas prices, and upward trends in miles driven
At NAPA Canada, sales held steady with low single-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter
This team performed fairly well, given the tough conditions in 2016, and we anticipate a more favorable overall sales environment in 2017. Similar to the U.S
and Australasia, the total vehicle fleet is growing due to the record new vehicle sales and gas prices remaining at historically low levels
These fundamentals bode well for NAPA Canada's continued growth prospects in 2017. Finally, in Mexico, our sales grew low double digits as well, as we expanded our NAPA Mexico footprint to 33 total stores during 2016. We have plans to add additional stores in the periods ahead and are encouraged by the long-term growth prospects we see for NAPA in Mexico
We were pleased to close the year with improved Automotive sales results in the fourth quarter
While we made progress in the U.S
, we intend to build on these results and we are encouraged as we move ahead in 2017. Furthermore, we expect continued strong results in our international Automotive operations, which have performed well for us
For 2017, we remain focused on expanding our business with our key commercial platforms, NAPA AutoCare and major accounts, executing on our retail strategy, and continuing to drive global expansion via new store openings, as well as targeted strategic acquisitions
So now let's turn to our Industrial business, Motion Industries, which represents 30% of our total revenues in 2016. Industrial was up 4% in the fourth quarter, which has significantly improved from the 1% decrease in the third quarter and also our strongest quarterly performance since the fourth quarter of 2014. In addition, comparable sales were up slightly, which has much improved from the decrease in comparable sales in each of the prior six quarters
For the full year, Motion sales are essentially unchanged from 2015. We are encouraged by the early signs of strengthening market conditions for our Industrial business, as evidenced by the year-end uptick in indices, such as the Industrial Production and the PMI numbers
In addition, the energy sector is making progress in its recovery, with the increase in rig counts translating into much improved sales to this sector
Lastly, the level of exported goods continued to improve from the 6% to 8% declines we experienced in 2015 and the first half of 2016, an especially positive sign for our equipment and machinery customers in the OE sector
Each of these trends bodes well for the overall industrial marketplace
Today the question is more of the sustainability, as these indicators have been quite choppy over the last several periods
That said, we entered 2017 encouraged by the prospects for stronger industrial sales
A review of our Motion business by industry segment, product category, and top customers further supports our fourth quarter improvement
We saw an increase in the number of sectors generating positive sales gains, with food processing, aggregate and cement, pulp and paper, and oil and gas, all out performing
It's worth pointing out that oil and gas improved from a double-digit decline in the third quarter to a double-digit increase in the sales in the fourth quarter, so solid improvement for this sector in just one quarter
And we had more of our product categories and top 20 customers generating sales increases in the fourth quarter, so positive trends across the business, which we expect to build upon in the quarters ahead, both organically and via strategic acquisitions
Moving on now to EIS, our electrical distribution segment
Sales for this group were basically flat in the fourth quarter and much improved relative to our results in the first three quarters of 2016. Total EIS sales were down 5% for the year and were 4% of the company's total revenue
The market served by EIS closely follow those at Motion, so our fourth quarter included a sequential improvement in comparable sales, as well as the accretive benefit of the CPS acquisition in October
Looking ahead, we remain focused on our initiatives to drive meaningful sales growth at EIS over the long-term
And finally, a few comments on the Office Products business, which represents 13% of the company's 2016 revenues
The Office group reported a 4% increase in sales for the fourth quarter, driven by a 12% sales contribution from acquisitions in the facilities, breakroom, and safety supply category
Total sales for the year were up 2%
Excluding acquisitions, comparable sales were down in the fourth quarter due to the decline in sales through our independent reseller and mega account customers
Sales to these customers were partially offset by the increase in sales to e-tailers, as well as our growing FBS distribution channel
On the product side, sales in the traditional office supplies, furniture and tech products, each posted sales decreases
Offsetting these declines was a substantial growth in our FBS category sales, which we have expanded to diversify our overall products and service offering
FBS sales were 31% of our total office sales in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus just 20% in 2015. As we move ahead to 2017, we remain focused on the continued expansion of our FBS business, including strategic acquisitions, as well as key initiatives to grow our overall share of wallet and market share across our product categories and sales channels
So that recaps our consolidated and business segment sales results
And in summary, we're pleased that the fourth quarter was our strongest quarterly sales performance of the year, with improved comparable sales trends in the Automotive, Industrial and Electrical businesses, relative to the second and third quarters of 2016. Generally, we believe that we operated in more favorable market conditions as the fourth quarter progressed and our teams were in position to capitalize and post improved results
In 2016, we executed on several of our initiatives to overcome the challenging sales environment and position the company for sustainable long-term growth
A few of the highlights include, strong growth in our international Automotive operations, 19 strategic acquisitions that enhanced our product and services offering, effective asset management that further strengthen our balance sheet, key capital expenditures and IT investments, including digital, to support future growth and distribution efficiencies, and finally, return of capital to shareholders via the dividend and share repurchases
So with that, I'll hand it over to Carol, who will provide a financial update and our outlook for 2017. Carol?
As we enter 2017, we remain committed to our global growth initiatives, which include the execution of fundamental initiatives to drive greater share of wallet with our existing customer base, an aggressive and disciplined acquisition strategy focused on both geographical as well as product line expansions, the building out of our digital capabilities across all four of our businesses, and the further expansion of our U.S
and international store footprint
We remain confident that our ongoing focus in these four key areas, along with our initiatives to drive significant cost savings, will positively impact our future results and produce the steady and consistent growth we look to achieve each year
So with that, we'll turn it back to Dana, and Carol and I will take your questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Hey
Good morning, Chris
And, Chris, just staying on Industrial for a minute
If you look at all the macro numbers, as we look at them, whether it be the ISM number, rig counts, we're seeing significant improvement
We've been through these cycles in the downturns in Industrial before
And it does feel – and we see it in both Motion and our Electrical business, that these two businesses are now poised for much better growth in 2017.
Matt, we were very active in 2016 with 19 acquisitions and $600 million in annualized revenue, quite a bit more active than we were in prior years
It's difficult to say, this is generally a long process, when we look at businesses and partnering with businesses
So you just – it's hard to gauge, because you just never know when they're going to come along, when the right one is going to come along
But I will tell you that we will remain active, not only across all four of our businesses, but across all of our geographical regions as well
Thank you, Matt
Yeah, we haven't – Greg, we haven't come off our long-term objectives on the number side
But based on what we see today, we believe that the guidance that we provided is achievable, but I can also tell you that our team is focused on not only reaching that guidance, but absolutely exceeding it this year
Thank you, Greg
Let me – I'll take the regional question first, Bret
First and foremost, I'm very pleased to tell you that every one of our regions we saw improved sales results in the fourth quarter and we also saw that gap narrow from what we had seen in Q3, and even a little bit into Q2 we saw that gap narrow by about 100 basis points
So we're still – our strong regions are still in the South, but I can tell you we see improved results in the Midwest and we saw improved results in the Central part of the country as well
So that December blast of cold definitely helped
This January warm temps are not helping us a whole lot, but that is what it is
Your second question, Bret, regarding product performance, our best performing categories, and probably not surprising, in Q4 were anything related to engine and electrical systems, so battery, starters, alternators, all performed well in Q4, filtration performed well
Some of the – where we saw a little bit of downturn within some of our T&E, tool and equipment, especially on some of the large equipment and some of our paint categories were off just a bit
No, I don't think so
Bret, I think it's timing
We have a robust tool and equipment business, and I think it's more one of timing
I don't think there is anything that changed dramatically in Q4 that would have impacted those sales
I think we'll see that rebound in Q1 going forward
Yeah, I would just reinforce Carol's comments, Bret
We continue to be very bullish on our international operations, and that's really all of them, Australia, New Zealand
We think we have expansion potential in those markets
Mexico, we will continue to expand our footprint there
In Canada, despite a challenging environment out West, our team up there had a good year
Where we need to turn it up is here in the U.S
and absolutely our team is focused on getting that done this year
I'm sorry?
Well, I'm not sure I'm ready to go there
All I know is, where we were a year ago in the depth, Bret, where – we're double the price of a barrel of oil today than we were a year ago
Rigs are coming back online and we're seeing a lift in that Southwest – we do a big business down in the Southwest and we're seeing a nice lift across that part of the country really in all of our businesses
All right
Thank you, Bret
Well, I'll take comp first, and then let Carol address your first question
So as we're identifying and defining comps, Chris, we're excluding new stores, new branches, or new stores, branches closed over the past 12 months, and we're also excluding acquisitions
It's a great question, Chris
I will tell you that we have a robust acquisition pipeline in really across all four of our businesses and, as I think I've mentioned earlier, in all of our geographical regions
I think what we're seeing is that in some parts of our business, when we do an acquisition, and I'd point out one that we did in Industrial with the acquisition of Braas in Q3 of last year, what that brings us is additional players in that space
When they see that GPC is, one, that we're acquisitive, and two, that we're a good partner, we have more and more some of these folks coming to us as opposed to us tracking them down
So we feel good about our prospects for 2017. I mentioned earlier, we did 19 acquisitions last year
I don't know that we'll be at that level of activity, but we certainly expect to be active again in 2017.
You bet, Brian
No, what we're seeing has been fairly typical of recent years, Brian
The pricing across the marketplace is rational and we're not seeing – and our supplier partners are partnering with us as they always have
We're not seeing any significant shifts there either
Thank you, Brian
