Good afternoon
I am happy to report another excellent quarter and with it another outstanding year for Synopsys
In fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.725 billion, an increase of 12.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.42, 13% growth, we generated $635 million in operating cash flow, our three-year backlog grew by approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion and we bought back $400 million of our stock
These results extended our multi-year track record of strong growth with three-year CAGRs of 10% for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, accentuated by upside from hardware and IP, our business became stronger and stronger as we moved through the year, resulting in good revenue growth across all product groups and all geographies
The fiscal ‘17 double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth was achieved through both revenue growth and increasing operating margin, even with acquisition-related dilution
Simultaneously, we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions with good organic growth, the Cigital acquisition in Q1 and the planned Black Duck transaction announced earlier this month
Trac will discuss the financials in more detail
As we assess the business we’ve built over the past 30 plus years and look forward to the next five years to 10 years, we’re enthusiastic about our prospects
The market opportunity is vast and increasing as we enter the age of Smart Everything
Synopsys is well-aligned to benefit from the emerging market dynamics
And lastly, our financial position and priorities amply support our aspirations
Let me expand on these three elements of our value proposition
First, the age of Smart Everything or Digital Intelligence is here
Following the decades driven by Computation and then Mobility, Digital Intelligence is the third major wave of electronics impact
Week by week we can see its reach growing, be it through the Internet of Things, automotive, virtual reality, medical devices or industrial
The need to manipulate massive amounts of data, apply AI through machine learning, while guaranteeing security is unstoppable
All of this is made possible with an insatiable hunger for next-generation advanced chips and complex software developed by our customers
Second, Synopsys is uniquely positioned at the very intersection of silicon hardware and software
Our design and verification tools are essential for the next-generation of advanced chips and systems
Our growing silicon-proven IP offering reduces risk and speeds time-to-market
In addition, our Software Integrity portfolio prevents code flaws from becoming security disasters
And third, we have maintained strong financial solidity while broadening our company TAM precisely for the opportunity at hand
Our recurring revenue model lets us consistently invest in advanced product development and support
We’ve managed our strong balance sheet and cash flow to enable both consistent stock buybacks and TAM-broadening acquisitions
And we’re driving shareholder value through long-term, high-single digit, non-GAAP earnings growth
Elaborating on our market and technical position, let me provide some highlights, beginning with EDA
With continued silicon and architectural sophistication, the success of next-generation chips is paramount in bringing about big data and machine learning opportunities
Synopsys EDA continues to enable astounding levels of complexity, resulting in strong demand for state-of-the-art solutions across our product lines
Even with strong competition and continued customer consolidation, we’ve fared well with growth outpacing the others over the past several years
We continue to strongly invest in our market leading digital design platform
Our solution has been instrumental in enabling many firsts, the first ever 10 nanometer production design, the first 7 nanometer tapeout, and now significant activity on early 5 nanometer designs
The largest ever FinFET design was implemented with the Synopsys platform, as was the largest networking processor in the world
Our digital platform is consistently trusted on the most advanced projects and is relied on for more than 95% of all FinFET designs
Our success is particularly evident in applications such as mobile, automotive, CPUs, graphics and AI-specific processors
And while we’re seeing share gains with customers across industries ranging from networking to storage to sensors, automotive has been particularly strong with nine of the top 10 automotive IC suppliers enabled through the Synopsys platform
Notably, at a leading automotive IC supplier, we’re growing and displacing the competition
Meanwhile, the move to smaller geometries continues
New manufacturing approaches, new materials, and new innovative transistor structures require our 3D TCAD expertise to develop them
In Q4, we announced the acquisition of QuantumWise, whose amazing atomic-level simulation tools enhance our ability to model the most advanced next-generation devices
In custom and analog mixed-signal design, our Custom Compiler and Circuit Simulation not only demonstrated excellent technical results but saw good revenue growth during the year
Customers such as MediaTek, Renesas, Panasonic, ST and TDK/Micronas have reported very successful deployments and tapeouts using our Custom Compiler solution, which is targeted specifically at FinFET designs
Now to verification, which continues to be an area of strength and growth for Synopsys
We realized a number of years ago that as chips and systems became more and more complex, verification would increasingly be required at the intersection of hardware and software
Over the last years, while collaborating with market leading customers, we developed a comprehensive verification platform that excels at exactly that
In fiscal 2017, our investments have resulted in another outstanding year of growth and share gains
One example is Samsung SARC, which chose our Verification Continuum, including simulation, formal, emulation, debug and verification IP as the primary solution for their advanced mobile processor designs
Strong customer adoption of our hardware verification products drove another record year as well
Among high profile customers presenting at the Design Automation Conference in June, AMD highlighted its use of our ZeBu emulation for early software development and bring-up
For software, emulation speed is critical and ZeBu is the fastest solution in the market
In Q4, we saw another example of the huge potential for our emulation
A mobile giant, faced with verification challenges inherent in software-rich mobile platforms adopted ZeBu citing its performance superiority
Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth
Over the past 15 plus years, we’ve built the broadest portfolio of IP titles and subsystems and have become a trusted partner and market leader
Our foundry relationships and active drive in standards groups ensure that customers can buy leading-edge products in key technology processes at the earliest stages
During 2017, we further expanded our portfolio, with continued focus on automotive, IoT and security
We expanded our IoT offering with our new ARC Secure IP subsystem for endpoint security and our IoT Development Kit to accelerate software development for sensor fusion, voice recognition and face detection designs
We announced the collaboration with Morpho, a leader in digital security and identity solutions to accelerate deep learning processing for embedded vision applications
In Q4, we acquired Sidense, adding One-Time Programmable Non-Volatile Memory IP, which is used in automotive and IoT among other markets
Our IP group has been a beneficiary of customer consolidation, providing outsourcing options to companies who want to target their limited engineering resources more towards differentiating their projects
Let me next move to our Software Integrity Group, which provides products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain
Customers for these solutions span semiconductor and systems companies, who are embedding considerable software content into their chips and devices, all the way to developers of software in industries such as financial services, medical, automotive and high-impact industrial
Over the past three-and-a-half years, we’ve become a clear leader in this emerging high-growth industry
Since our initial entry with the acquisition of Coverity, we’ve invested both organically and through key acquisitions to develop a product platform and services to better serve companies deal with daunting software security problems
As we gain scale and credibility, our brand recognition continues to strengthen
Gartner ranks Synopsys now as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing
During the year, we made good progress integrating the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, and are now seeing a positive impact on demand
Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Black Duck Software, the leader in testing Open Source software for known security vulnerabilities and license compliance
With Open Source making up 60% or more of all applications, this capability is critical to deliver a robust platform
Initial customer reaction has been great, as they recognize the benefits of combining Black Duck’s highly respected capabilities with the broader Synopsys offering
The acquisition is scheduled to close shortly, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions
Our vision and investments are resonating well with customers and we’re excited about the long-term potential of this product group
Lastly, I’ve mentioned a number of vertical markets this afternoon
One key vertical that is going through momentous change and is directly impacted by our end-to-end solutions is automotive
Let me provide some highlights resulting from our multiyear automotive strategy
Because safety is so critical, the automotive industry requires certification of products up and down their value chain
We’ve significantly expanded our portfolio of products certified for standards such as ISO 26262, including our functional safety test solution, which was certified in Q4. During this year, we’ve massively expanded our industry-leading automotive grade IP offering, including a broad portfolio of interface blocks that meet stringent automotive temperature requirements for the 16-nanometer FinFET process
In Q4, we extended a multiyear Automotive Center of Excellence collaboration with NXP, enabling early software development for next-generation electronic systems
We’re also well-recognized in the industry, serving as a leader on the Society of Automotive Engineers’ Cyber Security Task Force focused on driving new standards for software security
In summary, for Synopsys, fiscal 2017 was an excellent year, positioning us well going forward
We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the Board
Our EDA and IP products are delivering top-notch results for customers building chips to bring about the Digital Intelligence, Smart Everything age
And we’re making significant progress in scaling our software security platform and market leadership position
Let me now turn the call over to Trac
Yes
Well, RISC-V is sort of in its beginnings, but it is also one processor among many being built right now
This is aimed, I think, at being more a general purpose processor and maybe of high interest to some parties
But many people are focusing right now on the development of AI-specific processors, and so from our perspective as EDA and IP provider, it’s a little bit like the more the merrier, because we can support many people doing designs, and we expect many processes to be optimized specifically for the applications, because the hunger for more speed will be so high that just going to smaller geometries will not be sufficient, and therefore, people will say, “Hey, if I can build processors that are narrower and just aimed at some application and can make them faster,” and we’re seeing really a plethora of companies investing in them
Well, I think, the answer is yes, yes, yes, because there is no question that the overall global economy has done well, mostly because all regions are reasonably solid and so having those in unison tends to help things
Secondly, there is no question that semiconductor has had a very, very strong year
And in all fairness, this is after a few years of not being particularly strong and so these things tend to go up and down but up feels better than down, no question about that
And then, lastly, and I think that that is actually the factor that will matter most in the long-term is that, this move into this next wave of electronics enabling a very notion that was [indiscernible] in the ‘90s of artificial intelligence and outcomes under a set of other names, big data, machine learning, digital intelligence, I’d like to call it Smart Everything, that will drive a very broad consumption of semiconductors, because the amounts of data generated by IoTs and various forms of sensors are growing by leaps and bounds, and just think of any camera as being really billions of pixels being generated
Secondly, this data needs to be manipulated through machine learning, which is extremely compute in terms, and then the machine learning it in terms gets interpreted in the utilization, let’s say inside of a car for example
And then on top of that, you need to add one more aspect, which is security
And security, there is a very, very big component to that in the software part of our business, but it also will impact hardware as a variety of security modules will get added
So, I think, that semiconductor is at -- really at the heart of enabling a whole new wave of impact and therefore would stay reasonably healthy just on that basis only
Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we don’t give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions
And frankly, our first job is to always make sure that the company really lands well and that we can quickly look at what are the upsides for them with Synopsys or for Synopsys with them, that goes in both directions
Having said that though, I think, what is exciting about Black Duck is that, they are really have grown up and have impact to the whole aspect of software refer to as Open Source
And one of the biggest productivity increases and this is true on chips with IP, I think, it is true on software by virtue of our use of software and Open Source software is, of course, the fact that you can use software for many sources and assemble it quickly
There are quite a number of lurking dangers in that and there is a large catalogue of known vulnerabilities, and when people integrate this Open Source code material and they don’t pay attention to at least the vulnerabilities that already known, I think that’s closely delinquent when thinking about building secured software
And so it’s just a natural for us as an extension of our focus on quality and security of software
It’s actually a quite difficult question, because we touch many, many companies that are in the automotive space and we ourselves find it a bit challenging to know exactly what is in the automotive part and what is in the regularly semiconductor deliveries
Having said that though, the reason I like to highlight automotive is because it is such a poster child for what big changes are happening in an industry that traditionally was very slow in the adoption of any super advanced technology and so many semiconductor technology
I highlighted specifically the fact that we had invested substantially in automotive certified IP in FinFET 16, because three years ago nobody in their right mind would have ever associated the word FinFET in automotive and today all of the big providers in that value chain are focusing on that, because they need more computation inside of the car
And so the investments that we’ve made are not only to provide the tools that are suited for designing and modeling what goes into a car, but as you mentioned that also fulfill the existing standards that initially were all built up really for safety and only now are gradually being evolved towards security and those are words that we can certainly deal with very well
So I think we’re well-equipped to be a good provider in that value chain
Well, I am always careful answering questions like that, because often the claims get out of hand quickly
We have extremely competent competitors like Cadence and Mentor, of course, are the largest ones
In some areas, Cadence has been growing a bit faster in digital design
We have been growing faster in verification
Things ebb and flow and go back and forth
But in aggregate as an industry, we’re quite competitive, because we have to constantly develop technology that’s at the leading edge
And so, I think, I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies, we are all striving to be a good providers in a market that right now is doing very well and so we’ve had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now
You’re welcome
Well, a little bit everything you said is true, meaning that, there’s no question that when your customers do really well, they are a little less hesitant in spending money and semiconductors have been doing extremely well and I expected right now to continue for a bit
At the same time, the -- our solution in the verification space, the overall verification platform, which includes the emulation and the FPGA prototyping boards has done very, very well
And this is not completely a surprise, but somewhat difficult to predict in timing, because it follows what we have said, which is the center of gravity between hardware and software is going to increase in importance
With more complex software, people want to run the software before they have the hardware and therefore they model the hardware and that’s the basis that we’re in
The third aspect I would mention is that, our IP business has been very strong and that is definitely partially the result of continued investment in the most advanced nodes, which is difficult IP to do
And as you probably know the advanced nodes keep rolling out at a rapid pace, because the providers are very competitive with each other
And last but not least, the Software Integrity platform, so far I think is living up to our open expectations to be good pillar for the company that is on one hand completely adjacent to what we already do both in terms of technology and complexity and in many cases in embedded situations
On the other hand, it’s clearly a fresh TAM for us as we were talking to customers that in the past we would never have dreamed of interacting with
Jokingly, I sometimes say, we now have customers from Samsung to Starbucks, in fact is it’s actually true and so that is a very big opportunity space
This makes for a very long discussion, because we have -- we are now very, very rich in technologies in this domain
And this is a domain that has been extremely fractured in the past, and we’re already starting to get I would say very strong positive feedback from the number of CIOs or people that are responsible for the security of software that being able to interact with a company that has longevity and some mass, gives them a better feeling of security that we’re going to be around
That’s just another way of saying, there is a lot of work ahead and we are continually integrating capabilities
But it is after we really understand them well and so an integration is really a two-year to three-year process at many different levels
Having said that, Black Duck resonates very well with many of our customers and they understand immediately that doing some automatic checks on software that comes in from variety of not always understood sources is a good defense mechanism that they need and so, I think, that we will be well-equipped together with them to drive this area forward
You’re welcome
Well, for starters, we always start to look at this via a multiyear perspective, because acquisitions like that, they take some time to integrate, they have haircuts, they have a number of complexities on the financial side that that need to be understood on a longer term perspective
We have actually a fairly well-honed process of trying to understand the value of the acquisition based on the cash flow that comes out of it over many years
We don’t disclose the exact metrics, but we have a fairly good discipline for that
We review this for many years after the acquisition with our Board, always with some up and some down surprises, which is another word of saying, it’s always difficult to exactly predict
But in aggregate, it has been part of how we continue to create value for the company and in that context Black Duck is not an exception
Our own sense is that this is a particularly valuable acquisition, because of the strategic position it fills technically in the portfolio, but also because of the very acute value it can create by reducing the risk profile for customers
So, that is the process that we follow
Nothing is perfect and I am sure we can always do better, but we do have a long-term experience that has worked out pretty well for us
Well, this is an excellent question, because there are so many opportunities and your commentary is partially correct in that when we did the Cigital acquisition
Cigital was particularly focused on the financial sector
At the same time, my mentioning earlier of the automotive sector was interesting, because those people are just as interested in the issues of security and software as anything else
The other areas that are also highly paranoid about what can happen medical is a good example and you’ve seen some really horrific acts happening there
And so, I think, over time, no area, no verdict vertical is immune to the damages that can be done by essentially leaving the software doors wide open for hackers
And so this is going to become more and more a must do everywhere
But clearly, the sectors that are most sensitive also the ones that have been most attacked
And the financial sector, it quickly goes to the bottomline, because the attack means trying to steal money and that brings a very rapid reaction
So we are prudent in investing in verticals, because each vertical requires skills, it requires understanding the vocabularies and it requires understanding who to interact with
But I think our opportunity space will continue to grow and with is this part of our company broadening, we will put some more effort in understanding what are the best channels to do that, but so far I think we’ve been executing reasonably well
You’re welcome
Well, let me go backwards
We continue, of course, to always look at opportunities, at the same time, it’s also important to make sure that we executed well on the integration of the acquisitions that we’ve done so far
And while we have a number of teams that are extremely skilled at this, every case is different and so they take some time
And what is also interesting is that as we bring new members to our team, they bring fresh perspective, I like to call it fresh DNA that allows us to shop and how we think about the field
To be honest on your TAM question, I sort of read the same reports that most people do and I am equally skeptical if the number reflects any reality, because when you have a very rapidly developing market where there are many, many different, very fractured companies, that typically indicates that there’s a high need and that the need is still not satisfied or still in development and those are actually all positive words, because that’s just coming opportunity, but it also says that adding up whatever these companies have been able to do and then extrapolating this mostly spreadsheet effort
And I don’t want to be negative when people are trying to forecast it, because it is important, of course, but from our perspective, right now, the size of the TAM is the least of our issues
I think we have open space to run with and our challenge is how quickly can we execute on this, not are there more customers to call on, there are many more
So at this point in time, first a big thank you for having reported on us and supporting us during the year
Fiscal ‘17 turned out to be a very good year, not only from results point of view, but to most importantly from the perspective of preparing us for the next few years
And by now it already feels a little old and so we are fully proceeding on like on 2018 and hope to talk to you soon
As usual, we’ll be available for individual calls in a few minutes
