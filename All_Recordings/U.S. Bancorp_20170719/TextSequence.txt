Thank you, Andy
If you turn to Slide 5, I'll start with the balancing review and follow-up with the discussion of second quarter earnings trends
In the second quarter average loans increased 0.9% on a linked quarter basis and grew 3.4% from a year ago
Commercial loan growth rebounded from the first quarter increasing 2% sequentially
Line utilization has not increased materially, however, deal activity has strengthened and we continue to gain market share
As Andy mentioned, large corporate lending, there are momentum in the latter part of the quarter
Additionally, throughout the quarter we continue to see strong growth in middle market lending across many geographies
Commercial real estate lending reflects our prudent approach to certain CRE segments such as multi-family and retail given current market conditions
We did have opportunities for growth in construction lending
However, remain cautious in commercial mortgage markets where the competitive environment has created unfavorable conditions from a risk and return standpoint
In addition customers continue to refinance commercial mortgages in the capital markets given the rising rate environment and opportunity to extend maturities
We had particularly strong growth in retail leases as far as up 11% linked quarter where both a prime lender and a less or in the auto segment and our well established market position, full product offering and a strong dealer relationships that provided strong growth in both lending and leasing
We have made significant investments in this business over the past few years which is coming to fruition in the form of increased market penetration with both dealers and manufacturers
We expect growth will remain healthy for the next few quarters as we continue to penetrate market
I want to emphasize that leasing growth is not coming at the expense of increased risk
If you look at Slide 6, credit metrics remain very stable in our retail leasing portfolio
We have not changed our underwriting in this business and are not enhancing residual values
I would also highlight that in the second quarter the weighted average cycle score on originations for auto leases was 782. Turning to Slide 7, total average deposits increased 0.8% compared with the first quarter of 2017 and 7.7% on the year-over-year basis
Following the June interest rate hike, our total interest bearing deposit is in the mid 20% range
As future rate hikes occur we would expect the beta will gradually trend towards 50% level
On Slide 8 you will see the credit quality was relatively stable in the quarter, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans was 49 basis points in the second quarter and non-performing assets declined by 9.8% on the linked quarter basis
I will now move on to earnings results
Slide 9 provides highlights of second quarter results versus comparable periods
Second quarter net income of $1.5 billion was up 1.8% compared with the first quarter but was down 1.4% versus the second quarter of 2016. As a reminder, the second quarter of 2016 including two notable items; a $180 million Visa Europe gain in non-interest income and a $150 million non-interest expense related to interest accruals and a charitable contribution
Excluding these items net income increased slightly year-over-year
I will exclude the impact of these notable items when I discuss revenue and expense comparison versus the second quarter of 2016. Turning to Slide 10, revenue totaled a record $5.5 billion, up 3.1% on a linked quarter basis and 4.2% higher compared with the same quarter a year ago
Turning to Slide 11, net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $3 billion in the second quarter, up 2.4% compared with the first quarter and 5.9% higher than the second quarter of 2016. Comparisons in both quarters benefited from earning asset growth and higher interest rates
In the second quarter the net interest margin increased one basis point to 3.04% in-line with our guidance
The increase was primarily driven by rising interest rates partially offset by the impact of a flatter yield curve and higher cash balances which increased to meet certain regulatory expectations related to liquidity
We do not expect average cash balances to increase meaningfully from current levels
Slide 12 highlights trends in non-interest income which increased 3.9% versus the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher revenue, particularly in the payment services business
On the year-over-year basis, non-interest income increased 2% excluding notable items
Credit and debit card revenue increased 7.8% from a year ago on higher sales volumes
Merchant acquiring revenue grew 2.7% on a year-over-year basis adjusted for the impact of currency rate changes
In the second quarter we exited two merchant acquiring joint ventures which did not have a material impact on the second quarter results but will mute revenue growth comparisons for the next few quarters
Divestitures were in part -- due in part to changing priorities of the joint venture partners that were impacting future growth and profitability portfolios for us
Mortgage revenue grew about 2.4% on a linked quarter basis but declined 10.9% year-over-year, in-line with our expectations
Turning to Slide 13, non-interest expense increased 2.7% compared with the first quarter of 2017, primarily reflecting higher compensation expense and marketing and business development expense, partially offset by seasonally lower employee benefit expenses
On a year-over-year basis non-interest expense increased 6.4% excluding notable items, were also driven by higher compensation and other non-interest expense
Compensation expense grew mainly due to the impact of hiring to support business growth and compliance programs, as well as seasonal merit increases in higher variable compensation related to production
Other expenses increased primarily due to be impact of the FDIC insurance surcharge which began in the third quarter of 2016. Slide 14 highlights our capital position
At June 30, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio estimated using the Basel III standardized approach as if fully implemented was 9.3%
This compares to our capital target of 8.5%
I will now provide some forward-looking guidance for the third quarter
Given recent trends, we expect linked quarter total loan growth to be in the 1% to 1.5% range
Average earning asset growth will track with loan growth
We expect the linked quarter net interest margin to increase in a manner similar to the first quarter of 2017 which is within a range of four to five basis points
Let me take a minute to talk about merchant acquiring revenue
Last quarter we indicated that during the third quarter merchant acquiring revenue was expected to return to a more normal growth trajectory of same-store sales plus 1% to 2% excluding the impact of foreign currency changes
The adverse impact on sales volumes from exiting certain large volume customers is beginning to dissipate with reported sales volumes increasing 3.3% on a linked quarter basis
Given the anticipated revenue impact from exiting the joint ventures, we expect year-over-year merchant acquiring revenue will be essentially flat in the third quarter
Growth will begin to normalize in the fourth quarter and then heading into 2018. As Andy discussed, we expect to deliver positive operating leverage in each of the next two quarters supported by year-over-year expense growth of 3% to 5%, a level we target as more normalized on a long-term basis
Finally, we expect the taxable equivalent tax rate to approximate 29% in the third quarter
Let me hand it back to Andy for closing comments
Yes, so let me take that question
I think there is three broad things
From a compensation standpoint we expect that that will begin to moderate and continue to moderate third, fourth and into 2018 and that will be driven by the fact that we're getting close to the end of building out those risk and compliance programs, so that is kind of number one
Then cost related to risk and compliance such as like consulting activities; that are really have been helping us support some of those programs, has been moderating, it will continue to moderate as we go into the next few quarters and also into 2018. So those would be the biggest things and then a year ago FDIC implemented a surcharge and so we're starting to lap that and the year-over-year effect associated with the FDIC insurance will start to moderate
Unidentified Analyst And I'll keep my follow-up to expenses; and can you just help us understand the tax advantage investments and what does that mean for sequential growth as we go third, into fourth as well; it seems like you also had a bunch of that more in the other line this quarter
So can you just help us understand what that means for sequential growth as well? Thanks
We don't necessarily talk about that specifically but we do typically see the tax credit amortization expense start to move up in the third and then the fourth quarter
I think last year from third to fourth as an example it was up about $40 million to $50 million kind of a net ballpark
So that should give you kind of some sort of a range with respect to how that's going to change
Unidentified Analyst Okay, thanks guys, appreciate it
Yes, so on a linked quarter basis if you're going to look at just averages, we saw growth in deposits, both in our consumer business and then also in our corporate trust business
We end up looking at the ending cash balances, keep in mind that one of the things we were doing as we were building cash balances in order to meet some of those liquidity requirements; and in order to be able to do that one of the things that we did is a little bit of a pricing change related to some sort of deposits in order to bring some dollars in near the end of the quarter, and so that's why you see that
Kind of on a go forward basis when you think about cash balances, we don't expect the average balances to change much from current levels
You know, our guidance for the -- going into the third quarter we expected to spend -- expand four to five basis points from here
And one of the things, just -- when we end up looking at the one basis point movement in the second quarter, we had guided that it would be lower
One of the big reasons for that is really building the higher cash balance as that cost has got two basis points during that quarter and the flatter yield curve cost us a little bit but when we look at third quarter we feel pretty comfortable with that range of four to five basis points
When we look into the fourth quarter, at least right now, we would expect that the margin increase may not be at the four to five but it's still going to be kind of in that range of three to four, some and above
I think when you end up looking at deposit bidders overall, they talked a little bit about that
I do think that one of the things you're seeing on the wholesale side is that the deposit prices gain a little bit more competitive; and so we do see that picking up both in the June hike and as rate hikes continued in the future
And you know, I think that is going to continue to move up and as part of what we are so when we think about the positive bid as overall moving up closer to that 50 basis points, we're going to see more pressure on the wholesale side and on the corporate trust side
With respect to this rate hike?
I think we're probably further along on the wholesale side of the equation getting normalized betas and we have more space to go on the retail side which the beta there has been very low and we'll continue to go up as the next rate increases come forward
No, I don't know if we're done
I think that's all that we can really driven based upon what we see from a competitive standpoint but I don't think based upon the fact that we have cash balances where we're at, we don't necessarily see a need to drive deposits in
We're -- I would agree with you, I don't think there is a lot of upward pressure with respect to it
Deposit beta is both -- whether it's retail or wholesale etcetera, it's really tracking pretty similar to what we've seen in the past, maybe just a little bit higher
Yes, so let me take that
And so -- you know, the Fed is still kind of in the process defining what the level of balance sheet reduction and the pace of that overtime; and our expectation is that first of all, they're going to be very transparent as they go through that process and the pace is going to be very gradual, most likely several years
So we do believe that as -- kind of excess liquidity comes out of the market, we would expect there to be more competition for deposits and that is going to end up impacting pricing; I do believe that just because of the nature of the deposits on the wholesale side you're going to see more competitive and -- more of a competitive environment associated with that
Whether I'd be surprised if it's going to significantly impact 2017, and I do believe that just because it's going to be very gradual, it's going to also be very manageable and the market is going to respond accordingly
Erika, we continue to expect to have our people in process who are in place, their technology will be completed by the end of the third, into the fourth quarter and then it gets to the sustainability and part of the equation and that goes into early '18.
Yes
I mean usually there is a little bit of a seasonal effect that comes into play with respect to the third quarter but I think that's a reasonable assumption when you think about the third quarter
Yes
We end up increasing the securities portfolio really kind of in-line with the overall balance sheet growth; so if you think about what average loan growth is going to look like -- our average earning assets really kind of tracks in a very similar manner, so we would be adding to the investment portfolio in order to be able to do that but that's kind of one way to think about
I think that when we end up looking at the tax rate on a tax equivalent basis on a long-term basis, you know just because of growth it's going to -- because of the marginal effect it's going to drift upwards, so when I end up looking at certainly the next few quarters and going into 2018, the 29% is certainly more reasonable
I think wholesale will continue growing as it is and I think we'll start to see a turnaround in retail; so we've had strong growth, we've seen another portfolio that we talked about, a little bit less in terms of the home equity in traditional retail loan areas but I think we'll start to accelerate in future periods and I think that's how we get to the more normalized long-term growth rates
Gerard, thank you
We talked a little bit about that earlier but you know, when you end up looking at what the Feds -- the Fed still needs to kind of define a level of reduction in the balance sheet and really the pace of it and I think that they've been really transparent that that pace is really going to be gradual over several years and I think that that will cause any impacts of it to be very manageable on the banking industry
And as the market adjusts, I do think that as -- or we think as excess liquidity comes out of the market you could expect to see and you will expect to see more competition with respect to deposits, I would also expect that the long end of the curve on a relative basis would be a little bit higher; as a result some of their activities -- that have [indiscernible] from a deposit standpoint is most likely to come on the wholesale side of the equation
Gerard, I think it's both parts of the equation, it's accelerating revenue growth and moderating expense growth; positive operating leverage which will improve the efficiency ratio and ultimately improve ROA and ROE
Yes, so if you just end up looking at and trying to think about the growth rates over the next couple quarters, certainly reported growth rate is about 2.7% excluding the foreign currency as we said
I'd also say that same-store sales percentages and organic business growth has generally been quite strong which I think is good to see, that gives us insights with respect to the future
Reporting growth sales have been impacted by three factors; we talked last quarter about exiting some large volume low margin customers, that's been muting sales volumes and that has been dissipating and it's getting behind us, and certainly will be behind us as we get into the end of the third quarter; and so we're starting to see sales volume starting to grow
We are experiencing some margin compression in Europe because of interchange caps that were put into place late 2015, and that has continued to impact our year-over-year sort of growth rates and will continue to do impact at least through the third quarter if that will start to dissipate in the fourth quarter and then really be behind us as we get into 2018. And then the impact of exiting the two joint ventures will have an impact on merchant acquiring, really for the next several quarters as we think about the year
To kind of give us some, maybe specifics; when we look at the third quarter, we do expect the year-over-year growth rate for the third quarter to be essentially flat and that's essentially what we said
As I look into the fourth quarter, I do expect the fourth quarter year-over-year growth rate to be similar to what we saw in the second quarter of this current quarter
And then as we continue to see organic growth that we are experiencing, you know that will start to benefit us as we go into 2018. Unidentified Analyst Great
And are you able to disclose which JVs are not at this time?
I mean the one joint venture is related to our joint venture in Spain with Santander
And you know really, they've had changing priorities with respect to what they want to focus on; and as we think about Spain, it continues to be an area that has some economic challenges
So from our standpoint we really do believe that we have the opportunity to continue to grow in that market on our own with a focus on the right customers and I'd be very clear we're not exiting the market
With respect to the second joint venture, that is the joint venture with KeyCorp [ph], so we thought key merchant services; and in that situation our partner really wanted to focus on a third-party servicing arrangements and we respect that decision on their particular part
And we also say that we're retaining the clients that we believe will create the best growth opportunity for us as we move into the future
Unidentified Analyst Thank you, that was very detailed and I appreciate the answers
