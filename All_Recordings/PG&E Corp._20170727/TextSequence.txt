Good morning, everyone
I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, one that was marked by continued impressive operational performance, encouraging progress on the regulatory front and solid financial results
I'll start this morning with an update on some important actions we've taken this past quarter to continue strengthening our safety culture and operations
I'll then highlight some key investments we're making to enable us to meet our customers' evolving expectations while also keeping bills affordable
And finally, I'll cover some of the recent steps we've taken to help advance California's clean energy economy and position PG&E for continued success
After that, I'll turn things over to our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, David Thomason, to walk us through the financials as Jason Wells unfortunately has laryngitis, although he will be available for some questions
Before we dive in, I'd like to review the final decision we recently received in the cost of capital case
The decision sets our allowed return on equity at 10.25% through the end of 2019, which is critical, given the nearly $6 billion in annual investments we will be making in our gas and electric system over that same period
Just as importantly, our customers will benefit through lower rates, a savings of roughly $100 million annually
While I recognize it was a challenging process, in the end the cost of capital decision is yet another example of how coalitions can achieve effective solutions
I'm gratified to add this to the list, alongside the Diablo agreement we announced last summer and the 2017 GRC all-party settlement
Let's move now to a review of our safety and operational progress for the quarter
As you may recall, in 2014 we were one of the first utilities in the world to be certified under both the ISO 55001 and PAS 55 safety standards
Every three years we have to go through a rigorous recertification process
The critical requirement for recertification is to demonstrate continuous improvement
Well I'm happy to report that Lloyd's Register, the internationally recognized third-party auditor, recently recertified us in both ISO 55001 and PAS 55. This is independent third-party confirmation of our continually improving safety culture and industry-leading asset management program
And it's something I'm extremely proud of
I want to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank our teams on a truly great accomplishment, one that reflects our laser-like focus on safety, not just in the gas operations but across the company
Staying on the theme of continuous improvement, I'd like to talk about the report that was issued in May in the CPUC's Safety Culture OII
We genuinely welcome and appreciate the thorough assessment and recommendations contained in the report
It's encouraging that the CPUC's consultant recognizes the numerous improvements we've made as a company to our safety culture
In fact, the first conclusion of the report affirms that, quote, "PG&E employees at all levels are committed to safety," end quote
That speaks volumes about the culture we're building and I couldn't agree more
Safety is at the heart of everything we do here at PG&E
Looking at the 68 specific recommendations in the report, most are fully consistent with our own safety plans
While there are a few recommendations in the report that we believe warrant further consideration by the CPUC in the upcoming proceeding, we agree with the vast majority of the recommendations and plan to implement them by the middle of next year
Moving on to our operational performance, we had a number of highlights this past quarter and I'd like to focus on one in particular
This past June, most of California was hit by a historic heat wave
Millions of customers experienced temperatures in the triple digits for nearly a week
Demand on our system hit levels that we haven't seen in over a decade, reaching over 20,000 megawatts on June 22, just shy of our all-time system peak in 2006. The good news is that less than 2% of our electric customers experienced a sustained loss of power during the peak outage day
Our strong reliability performance was even more noteworthy, given that one of our Diablo Canyon units was in a planned refueling outage during the same period
And in addition, at certain times during the heat wave, more than half of PG&E's energy supply was met with RPS-eligible resources
This experience is a testament to the long-term investments we've made to modernize our system and it demonstrates what we've been saying for quite some time and that is, we can deliver the clean energy that our customers want and still provide great safety and reliability
With our strong operational performance in mind, I would like to touch upon a couple of recent regulatory developments that help set the foundation for our future investments and will enable us to continue to deliver on our customer's evolving needs and expectations
The first is the final decision in our 2017 General Rate Case, which approved the all-party settlement between PG&E and our intervenors, including consumer advocates TURN and ORA
While this gives us a clear line of sight into our distribution and generation revenues for the next three years, it also enables our plans for making the infrastructure investments necessary to meet our customers' energy needs
For example, the GRC authorizes CapEx increases related to electric reliability improvement, network cable replacement and capacity increases to support distributed generation resources
These are the same types of investments that enabled us to provide the safe and reliable service during the recent heat wave
We're pleased with the outcome of the GRC decision which approves 98% of our rate base request and provides us with the resources needed to support continued investment in the grid
At the same time, we went into this rate case very mindful of the need to keep our customer bills affordable and the outcome represents a fairly modest 1% increase in our authorized revenues for 2017. The second regulatory development I'd like to mention this morning is our electric transmission case, TO19, the application which we filed yesterday at FERC
We're seeking a $74 million increase in revenues starting in 2018 for such key capital investments as system reliability work and substation modernization
It is through these types of investments and these continued investments in our grid that we can help ensure our system is stable and that we can continue providing the high-quality service that our customers have come to expect
The last area I'll cover this morning is the work we're doing to position PG&E for success in the future energy markets
In addition to the investments we're making to upgrade and modernize our grid, we are also leveraging our proximity to Silicon Valley to pilot new technologies and systems, in effect, beta testing, the grid of the future
The rapid growth of both large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources, or DERs, means that we as a grid planner and operator, we have to find ways of managing third-party assets that we don't own or don't control, assets such as private rooftop solar or electric vehicles
We have to work on this as a system rather than look at these individual items in isolation
In one of our many pilot projects we're working with General Electric, Tesla Energy and Green Charge Networks to test a distributed energy resources management system on three interconnected feeders this summer
The pilot includes private, residential rooftop solar with smart inverters, residential battery storage, commercial/industrial battery storage and a utility scale battery storage facility that PG&E owns and one which has the capability to sell into the wholesale market
What's unique about this pilot is that it gets right to the core of our grid modernization work, namely having visibility into all the resources that our customers are connecting to the grid and understanding how they respond when we, as a grid operator needs to manage them for the overall safety and reliability of the electric system
Now in order to succeed in the future energy market, we not only need to invest in the right technologies and systems, we also need to have the right policies in place to help us achieve the state's clean energy goals
You may recall that during our Q1 earnings call, I mentioned the portfolio allocation mechanism, or PAM, filing that PG&E and the other California investor-owned utilities jointly submitted to the CPUC
In the filing, we proposed to replace the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment with an updated approach that more fairly allocates costs and benefits between customers who choose CCAs or direct access, and those who stay with their existing energy provider
This is a critical issue where all parties recognize the need for reform
On June 29, the CPUC voted out a new Order Instituting Rulemaking to review, revise and consider alternatives to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment
While the CPUC at the same time dismissed the PAM application, we view the new OIR as a clear recognition of the need for reform to ensure that costs are fairly allocated to all customers in compliance with the state law
The CPUC has recognized the issues with the current mechanism and we will have the opportunity to advocate with the other IOUs for the types of reform that were included in the PAM application
In closing, I want to reiterate that this has been a strong quarter
We continue to make steady progress in our safety culture and we provided impressive reliability for our customers despite a record-setting heat wave
We also achieved a number of positive regulatory outcomes, including the General Rate Case and the Cost of Capital decisions, which provide a solid foundation for the investments we will be making in our system
With that, let me thank you for joining us and let me turn things over to David to walk us through the financials
Yeah, you know the ones we've talked about historically which are outside this period is, what ultimately happens with high-speed rail, what ultimately happens with some of these really large state-sponsored projects
I think that provides an opportunity
More near term, I continue to think that there's great opportunity around electrification of transportation
I think at this continued improvement or opportunity for us to continue making investments and our bread-and-butter work, modernizing the electric lines and modernizing our pipes
So longer term, it's the things that are outside the range like the high-speed rail
Short term, it's our bread-and-butter work
