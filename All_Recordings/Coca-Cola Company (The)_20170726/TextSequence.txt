Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone
As we pass the midpoint of the year, I'm pleased to say that we are where we expected to be and remain on track to deliver our full year guidance
Importantly, we continue to accelerate the transformation of our business into a total beverage company by driving against the strategic priorities we laid out at CAGNY: mainly, expanding our portfolio with new products, marketing platforms and a consistent strategy to offer our customers the best consumer-centric beverage portfolio; second, driving revenue growth through enhanced revenue growth management strategies and a strengthened system; third, digitizing our enterprise; and fourth and very importantly, unlocking the power of our people as we instill a growth culture and establish a new, leaner operating model
With this as the backdrop, I'd like to talk about our performance in the quarter and then drill down into actions that we are taking to drive top line growth and finally update you on refranchising and our new operating model
So firstly, starting with the quarter, ultimately amidst a weak consumer retail environment in emerging markets, particularly Latin America, and some softness in North America, our actions are enabling us to win in the market
Globally, we gained value share in total non-alcoholic beverages and in most of our category clusters
As expected, organic revenue grew 3% in the quarter
Not only did we see a strong performance in rapidly expanding areas of our business, such as Innocent in Europe, but our revenue growth was also largely driven by innovation in sparkling soft drinks where we have continued to roll out Coca-Cola Zero Sugar around the world
Price mix continues to benefit from a focus on smaller pack sizes
Globally, our immediate consumption packs which are typically sold at a higher retail price per ounce grew unit case volume 3% in the quarter
Taken together with the effective management of our portfolio and cost structure, solid pricing enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong underlying operating margin expansion
Now turning to look around the world, many of our developed markets, particularly North America and Europe, continued to perform well
In North America, improving performance in our refranchised territories with a disciplined approach to volume, price and mix management and some favorable timing of shipments in our foodservice business led to an organic revenue growth of 5%
In our Europe, Middle East and Africa group, solid marketing and innovation along with improved alignment with our bottling partners resulted in strong 6% organic revenue growth
Importantly, though, some of our larger markets like China and Nigeria are also accelerating top line revenue growth this year as we accelerate the revenue management strategies
However, as I noted earlier, there are still regions around the world experiencing political instability and some challenging economic conditions
Most of Latin America, including Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela, remain difficult operating environments for consumer products companies
Additionally, while we believe India has taken the right steps towards modernizing its monetary and tax system, new policies have resulted in near term uncertainty for retailers and consumers that impacted the beverage industry in the first half
In all of these instances, we are responding quickly to the volatile external environment and building strategies that will allow us to deliver value to our customers by responding to these new challenges faster than the competition
Now, let me turn and take a deeper look at some specific actions we're taking to drive revenue growth
These efforts are the result of a keen focus on innovation, small pack sizes and more robust segmentation strategies
For example, in China, we launched new innovative versions of Minute Maid Pulpy brand to serve the premium consumer segment at retail prices above the original version
In Europe, innocent, our premium juice and smoothie brand, continued to outperform with double-digit revenue growth as a result of expanded distribution and product innovations, such as pack improvements and the launch of new, higher-value-added smoothies
Within our sparkling soft drinks, revenue growth was driven by our no-sugar options, where we are perfecting recipes, expanding availability and supporting enhanced execution with the right level of marketing support
Specifically, we continue to see excellent results from Coca-Cola Zero Sugar
This product has demonstrated strong consumer appeal in Europe, Mexico and other markets, resulting in double digit global volume growth for the brand year-to-date
So, we will continue to roll this new and improved product out across key markets, including the U.S
, supported by substantial marketing and media support
And with its even more Coke-like taste, we expect it to continue to be a growing and important part of our portfolio
You all know that small packs are an important part of our business
They enable us to provide price mix-accretive offerings at affordable consumer price points as well as high-value products in developed markets like the U.S
This year's success of the small pack initiatives in China, South Africa and Central and Eastern Europe is helping to deliver growth in these markets
Finally, we are looking to grow through more robust segmentation of our existing portfolio
In West Africa, for example, we are tailing (8:01) our package offerings and trade incentives for rural and urban markets even further and, as a result, we are delivering stronger top line results
Now, to support all of these initiatives, we have been taking significant action to strengthen our system
In May, we held our annual Global System Meeting, and the level of engagement among our bottling partners was very high
They are encouraged by the innovation we are bringing to the market and are committed to support our investments with enhanced focus on local execution
And over the past year, we started to see tangible results, starting, let's say, in North America
We've seen continued strong performance from our bottlers as we complete refranchising and are confident in the actions we have taken to complete the changes this year while also improving execution in the marketplace
For example, we are seeing improved execution from Coca-Cola UNITED and Coca-Cola Beverages Florida across the state of Florida
In territories it acquired, UNITED is increasing outlet penetration in eat and drink channels whilst also improving same-store sales with local convenience stores and workplaces
These are the types of account where at the local touch from our network of independent bottlers provides a significant strategic advantage and is one of the reasons why our overall performance in North America has consistently outshined our performance in measured channels
And I'm pleased to say that we are getting close to finishing our planned refranchising activities
With the latest letters of intent to divest both West and the Tri-State Metro Operating Units, we now have 100% of the U.S
territories of Coca-Cola Refreshments under agreement or letter of intent
Turning to Europe, we are already seeing better results than we have seen in several years from this important profit center as our new pan-regional bottler, Coca-Cola European Partners, leverages best practices from its three predecessors and we work together to bring new products to the market at a faster pace
Turning to Asia, Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan completed its first quarter as an integrated company, and earlier this month, we completed refranchising of all our company-owned bottling operations in China with the sale of the Shanghai bottler
Finally, turning to Africa, we reached agreement with the South African government on conditions addressing public interest considerations in connection with our planned acquisition of ABI's stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa
Over the coming months, we will continue to work with the various regulatory approval processes and expect to close these transactions around the end of the year
As a reminder, we plan to account for these bottling territories as discontinued operations until they can be refranchised to other partners
As I laid out earlier this year, we are also embracing a new operating model and changing our culture to smart risks and be more growth orientated
As we expand our portfolio, we are taking a test and learn mentality which means some things will work right off the bat, some will need tweaking and that's all okay
For instance, we launched Honest Tea in Europe earlier this year and learned that the brand resonates better with consumers in certain channels, so we've immediately begun to evolve the packaging format and go-to-market channel strategy
We are seeing what consumers want and making adjustments immediately
At the end of the day, speed and agility are critical in this rapidly changing consumer landscape
Now turning to our Lean center initiatives, we are on track
Much of the organizational design work we outlined earlier this year is now complete and we are rapidly implementing our new corporate structure to support faster growth
While these large-scale changes are never easy, our associates understand the need for our company to adapt and I am very encouraged by how well the organization is embracing the transformation
Our system has proven that it is taking the right actions to be successful in the market and going forward, we will remain relentless in becoming a more efficient, leaner, more agile while continuing to expand our portfolio, therefore building a strong position for future growth
Looking at the back half of the year, we will continue to face many of the macro headwinds we have seen year-to-date and over the past few years
However, we are building on a solid marketing calendar, an innovation pipeline, and strong execution
And I am confident we will achieve our full-year outlook
So with that, I will turn the call over to Kathy to take you through our numbers
Yeah, I think we've said that we're going to manage the year, and we're going to try and put into that balance the obvious building of the business over the long term
We have stated that we'd like to get out of the trend of declining EPS, which we've seen in the last few years, and that we are going to invest where it makes sense
So, we are constantly looking at where that places our momentum and should we invest more, and we have done so
And we have increased our plans in the downhill in a couple of places where we see really good momentum and the good reasons to invest for better results
But the world remains volatile, and there are places where the environment is better suited to affordability, to returnables, to adjustments and where markets are just frankly under a lot of macro pressure
Extra investment is not going to drive us very far
So, we will continue to manage it with flexibility
We know that going forward, we'll have some of the money we're going to generate out of Lean Enterprise, to look across the portfolio, but we're going to decide that on an ongoing basis
Good morning, Judy
I think a couple of things
On an as-reported basis, you will indeed see an acceleration in the back half, principally because we have an extra day in the fourth quarter and we had the less days in the first quarter
So, I think as you look at the reported numbers, there will be some acceleration
Now, underlying that and seen in its most simple sense of taking unit cases and price mix, as you say, we did roughly 3% in the first quarter and roughly 3% this quarter
We're guiding to 3% for the rest of the year because, frankly, the world has not changed
We're doing a lot of the right things in the places that are going well, and frankly, some of the ones that need to be fixed
But we don't see the world is improving rapidly, and therefore we're not banking on that happening and so we're more focused on doing what we know needs to be done and having a moderate view of how that's going to play out in the rest of the year
And I think the expectation for the downhill should be more of the same of what we've had so far this year, hopefully with some of those macro situations improving as we get towards the end
Yes
I think the headline answer is yes, it's happening
And I think it was part of the design and the strategy
To be fair to the team running CCR, they have been improving the operations of Coca-Cola Refreshments over the years and have been getting increasingly better results over time and doing a lot of the things that set the platform for better local operations and better coordinated national operations
But there's no question that as the bottlers have taken over these new territories, they have been very energetic in trying to improve them
They have made good progress particularly in some of the non-directly measured channels, the up and down the street, the smaller stores where they build on their local expertise
So, I think, it is in aggregate a tail-wind
It was part of the strategy that it should be that way, and I think, it's a compliment to the local bottlers that they are driving that forward
Yeah, sure
Morning
I think, we're very happy that we're doing well in teas and coffees, both globally and in North America
Obviously, the Dunkin' one is early days
Good start
I think, Gold Peak is a good tea brand and again, an early start on the coffee
The basis of our kind of ready-to-drink coffee business and strong global position is actually Asia
So we have some strong brands there
So I don't think you should see it as there's going to be one brand for ready-to-drink coffee and ready-to-drink tea across the world
We're going to see some strong growth coming out of Asia in Asian teas
Yes, we're launching Honest Tea in Europe as the joint venture with Nestle winds down teas in the European space at the end of the year
So you will see us use some of our brands more broadly, but it won't be one brand everywhere
Net-net, we are positive on the long-term growth opportunity for both ready-to-drink teas and coffees
We will end up with a portfolio of brands, particularly as it relates to different geographies
And each will have its own positioning, but, in the end, the consumer will decide the one it wants
And if all work, great
If two work, then we'll take one out
Maybe we'll bring one more in
But we'll continue to pay attention to what the consumer wants and help customers grow their businesses by selling our brands
I mean, I'll give you a couple of ideas
But I think the net of the answer is it's more of a cultural process than a process-process
Having said that, we're clear on when we're talking about test and learn or experiment, that people need to understand the scale and the potential impact of the experiments they're undertaking
In other words, we are starting to use some frameworks to classify how people are going after things
So said in simple terms, if the test you're undertaking is not life threatening, do lots of them, learn quickly, and move on
I mean, if the experiment is potentially creates a material risk if it goes wrong, then let's look at it more closely
So we're starting to push through some ways of looking at the portfolio in the market so that they can categorize what sort of strategy and what sort of scale of experiment are they undertaking, whether it's a launch of a product or a new marketing program, et cetera, et cetera
And so the risk can be managed appropriately
And it's all about what's the potential downside to the corporation
And that, if it's not big, or said differently, if it's very small, then it's okay to let them go
But as I said at the beginning of the answer, it's mainly a cultural mindset
It's the essential idea that the world is undergoing some important structural changes, multiple ones at the same time
And that is causing disruptions on many fronts, and we have to continue to do what we've done for 130-plus years, which is stay relevant for the consumer and help our customers grow their businesses
And that's cultural
So we need people to really be focused on where do we stand really, to be curious about what's going on in the world, to kind of not look at things through rose-tinted glasses and come to quick conclusions and move on
Why? Not because we fancy it and it's a nice thing to have
It's because that's what's needed in the marketplace
And I think the employees understand that
I think that's why the Lean Enterprise is resonating, and I think that's why it will get pushed through
And we'll back that up with some tools and processes to help people
We're making much more embedded into the organization the use of real agile processes and agile teams because that's the way that we're going to get to answers quicker
Morning
And yeah
Yes, we saw some weakness in the water and sports drinks categories in the second quarter
Some of that was weather in May
There was a particularly poor period there
I don't like throwing the weather under the bus, but that's the Q2. I think in the longer-term trend, well, I think water will continue to grow, particularly enhanced water, premium waters, I think, you see a lot of activity by ourselves, by competitors in that space
So I think that is going to come back and will continue to be a source of growth for the industry
And we will participate very competitively
And it will be a source of growth for us
So I think it's a moment in time
Good morning, Laurent
Laurent Grandet - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Hey
I think you will have surprised many with your 5% organic growth in the U.S
, especially after the soft quarter from your major competitor and still potentially with some disruption from transferring to bottlers
So how should we think about the price-mix going forward? Is 4% the new norm in the U.S
, and by extension in developed countries? And if you can give some colors about what's coming from price, what's coming from mix, that would be helpful
Thank you
Clearly, I'm not going to say that 4% is the projectable price-mix for the U.S
I think that's the top-end of what would happen
I think, it's important as you look at the U.S
result, I mean, clearly it was a good quarter and we're pleased that it comes on top of multiple years of the U.S
business performing at the top-end of large consumer products companies
A couple of points that are very important to note
Firstly, we benefited in the second quarter from a little bit of extra gallons in the food service business that was kind of inventory call that a point
So, it was really more of a full percent
Now we're getting a lot of that in the non-measured channels
We're getting it through the small packs
It's about a balance between mix and rate
We've got transaction packs growing mid-single digits in the quarter, high-single digits year-to-date in sparkling
So it really is a bit of a sweet spot between rate and mix
As I said, it won't stay up at that high level because of the effects of the extra food service gallons
But they are executing strategy, and I think, it's playing out very nicely
Yeah, let me start with Asia and then work towards Japan, Lauren
I think, there was some softness in Asia
We would have liked to see Asia come in better
I would call out obviously the slight disruption in India from the general sales tax obviously affected us in the back-end of the quarter
As I said in the opening remarks, we think that's good for the country, but it did obviously make some impact in the second quarter
And we're seeing softness across some of the ASEAN countries
Each has their own reasons, but the ASEAN region has been soft
China bounced back a little bit
Japan had a solid quarter
It wasn't knocking out of the park like it has on some of the previous ones
There were some kind of cycling things in there
But we've had some good launches with some local products in Japan, Coca-Cola FOSHU, I need more time than I have now to explain it, but a pretty solid result
So, year-to-date, Japan is going reasonably well
Obviously we've got the new bottler coming into being, which sort of affects the inventories that we sell into them, which kind of makes it look like they're not doing as well as they should
But I think Japan is going to continue to do well
China bounced back
So coming back to the beginning, it's really about India and ASEAN
Thanks, Kevin
Look, I think a couple of factors
Just mechanically, if Brazil and Venezuela had been flat in the quarter, we'd have grown 1 point faster
So you could say, okay, well, by next year, Venezuela will have declined so much it won't matter, and Brazil I think there's some belief that it will get better as we come out of the year
So if you want it on a mechanical basis, yes, mathematically, if everything else stays roughly the same, then we'll get there next year as Brazil and Venezuela stabilize
Now, other countries could fall off the wagon, and so that's always an uncertainty
Having said that, our underlying core revenue growth, organic growth, in the second quarter was actually 4%
So, if you strip out the bottling operations that we know we're going to sell, we talked about the core growing 4% last year
It grew 4% in this quarter
So I think in there is the seeds of that number as we go into 2018. We're not making a projection on 2018 yet, but I think on the line are the bread crumbs towards that conclusion
Look, I think clearly the company's role is to provide some leadership to the system and obviously the marketing of the brands, the marketing and innovation to create the business in the countries that they operate in
So to the extent the company doesn't do that, it's always going to be a problem on alignment
Similarly, if the bottler's not taking advantage of when there are all those things and investing in execution, investing in the capabilities that develop the marketplace, to expand the number of outlets, to build a stronger base of cold drink equipment and the sales capability to help the customers develop their businesses, then there will be alignment problems
So net-net, both sides need to come to the table with that piece of the equation and get it done
And when either side slips, yes, we have more robust conversations, but this is a business that really works well when both are coming to the table
Sure
I mean, I think, firstly, it's gone really well
Global volume growth for Coke Zero Sugar has stepped up over the last few years from mid-single digits to high-single digits, and now it's running in the teens
So it's done well in Western Europe, and that's really good
But actually, the global growth continues to accelerate, and we think it has a long way to go
And in terms of bringing it to the U.S
, of course, we're bringing it to the U.S
because we think it will do better and help the U.S
And you asked the question about, are we phasing out Coke Zero? It is a re-invention of Coke Zero, and it is a slight repositioning and, yes, it is about helping the zero-calorie part of the portfolio grow, which is linked to playing a role in tackling obesity
And by that I mean, it's part of what we call the one-brand strategy
So Coke Zero Sugar, of course, is an improved version of the Coke Zero Sugar formula but it comes in more of a red visual identity, more of a red can, with more of a red label, and will actually help people stay in the Coca-Cola franchise
And whether they want the original with sugar or they want a Coke Zero Sugar without any, and it's less switching between brands, which will ultimately help us keep and attract more consumers
Hi, Carlos, good morning
Good question, Carlos
Look, I think the first thing is it's going to be clear to the associates why we want change rather than just asking for it
And so part of the task is helping everyone understand the business necessity of the need for change
As I mentioned earlier, the world is undergoing a lot of structural change and what it's driving towards is a place where the speed at which consumers, customers and the rate at which insights can be generated from data to give competitive advantage is changing such that the cycle of speed, experimentation, and learning will create higher business volume
And firstly, you have to land the idea that you've got an ultimate competitive and business value underpinning rather than I prefer X versus Y
How do you drive it forward? Well clearly, in order to get that done, you do need some technical skills
We'll need more consumer digital engagement-type skills, more e-commerce type skills, more artificial intelligence type skills, and more collaboration type skills
In terms of the behaviors, in order to take advantage of that competitive cycle, you need greater transparency
So we need to push behaviors where the information is made available, more broadly, more transparently, more quickly
We need to keep encouraging a candor of looking at where we really are, opportunities and issues, no rose-tinted glasses because then you get to the insight quicker
That has got to go along with a greater curiosity
We've got to – one of the dangers being 130-plus years successful is you think you've got the answer to some things whereas we really need to have lots of curiosity about how things could be different, could be better, and how we respond to the way things are changing and then, of course, there needs to be some courage to try new things
I talked earlier about that's got to be managed with risk appetite
All experiments are not born equal and there will be lots of tolerance for doing it in a sensible way and then commitment to making things better
And I think all of that can be created
Of course, the tone needs to be set from the top
We need to put in place the training and the programs and if people understand why, I think you get a much more empowered autonomous organization that is capable of creating a better future
Yeah
Let me talk about the question around the bottling system and refranchising
Firstly, yes, there are some legacy small bottlers, but principally the U.S
bottling system by the end of this year will be a relatively small number of bottlers distributed in a very logical geographic distribution across the country, which has moved away from the great mosaic of the past of the patchwork quilt
I think what we will have is people who are really strong locally in their marketplaces where they know what to do and the U.S
is not one place, there are lots of local differences, but the important element of the strategy in the U.S
is the putting in place of the structures and mechanisms so the system can act as one; act as one with customers; act as one from a production system; act as one in terms of IT; act as one in terms of really working out what's the strategy
So, it will be a strong combination of local knowledge and the ability to act across the system
I think they've done a great job over the last several years in bringing it to life and delivering top-class results in the U.S
environment and I think that's going to continue to be the system of the future
Thank you, Kathy and Tim
So midway through the year, we are on track
We will continue to transform our business and culture, and we fully expect to meet our full-year guidance
So, as always, thank you for your interest, your investment in our company, and thank you for joining us this morning
