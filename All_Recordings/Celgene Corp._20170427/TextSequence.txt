Thank you, Peter, and good morning everyone
Hematology and Oncology franchise had a very good first quarter of 2017. We delivered a strong sales performance with 18% year over year growth and 1% sequential growth
We are very pleased with this result, and in addition, delivered against some critical regulatory and clinical milestones
REVLIMID had an excellent first quarter and overcame the expected buying patterns and U.S
coverage gap challenges that we typically see in Q1. Our newly diagnosed myeloma launch continues to drive global increases in demand and duration
POMALYST/IMNOVID is significantly growing versus the same quarter in 2016 due to increasing use of triplets and duration gains
Finally, ABRAXANE continues to be stable overall with U.S
buying patterns impacting the Q1 performance
REVLIMID net sales grew 20% year over year and an impressive 4% quarter over quarter
Growth was strong in the U.S
and outside of the U.S
, we had an excellent 24% growth year over year and 4% sequential growth
growth in Q1 was driven by an increase in both new and repeat prescriptions
International REVLIMID growth was also very strong, with 13% year over year and 5% sales growth
Year over year and sequential international volume growth were 22% and 13% respectively
NDMM market share continues to grow outside of the U.S
, with a positive uptake both in the EU and in Japan
We have obtained and given NSCT reimbursement in 20 countries around the globe and are finalizing reimbursement in France
With this regulatory approval in the U.S
and EU for REVLIMID as maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplantation and we're already able to obtain reimbursement in six European markets
As we mentioned before, we believe this indication will be a significant opportunity for REVLIMID globally
market, there is still a large portion of patients who do not receive REVLIMID maintenance or who only receive a fixed duration of REVLIMID treatment
The recent approvals will allow us to educate physicians on the unique value proposition of REVLIMID post autologous stem cell transplantation and continue to highlight the need for treatment to disease progression
In Europe, there's an even greater opportunity, with very few patients receiving maintenance therapy to date
We are also advancing our plans to submit an sNDA for RVd in first line transplant and non-transplant patients
We had positive interactions with health authorities and are pleased with the progress being made
We expect a submission in U.S
by year end
Finally, we are awaiting the Phase III results of our indolent lymphoma programs
The (14:15) RELEVANCE and AUGMENT trials are both expected to read out by the end of 2017. POMALYST/IMNOVID net sales grow 33% year over year
, POMALYST net sales grew 26% year over year and we saw 1% decline quarter over quarter
The underlying demand is very strong and total prescriptions grew in Q1 versus Q4. Demand growth was offset by the gross-to-net impact of the coverage gap and some inventory fluctuation
and internationally, POMALYST/IMNOVID is maintaining a market leading position in 3rd line+ despite new entrants
We have strong increases in treatment duration for POMALYST/IMNOVID globally and we expect to see dynamic growth during the rest of the year
An important near term growth driver in the U.S
will be the expected FDA approval of POMALYST in combination with daratumumab for relapsed refractory myeloma by June of this year
Finally, as mentioned on our Q4 call, we are successfully enrolling key development programs for POMALYST/IMNOVID to further support the use of multiple combinations
We are pleased to announce that our Phase III OPTIMISMM trial, in combination with bortezomib in second or later treatment line completed enrollment during the first quarter and we expect data in 2018. ABRAXANE continues to have quite stable demand
ABRAXANE net sales grew 5% year over year and declined by 11% quarter over quarter, impacted by U.S
customer buying patterns that we typically see in Q1. ABRAXANE U.S
sales were flat year over year
ABRAXANE maintains its leadership position in pancreatic cancer and demand is stable in breast and lung cancer
Outside of the U.S
, ABRAXANE grew 16% year over year and was stable quarter over quarter
We continued to see growth in pancreatic cancer outside of the U.S
and have multiple growth drivers ahead for ABRAXANE
We expect results of the apact adjuvant pancreatic cancer trial to be available by the end of 2017. And the pivotal ABRAXANE (16:17) combination trials in non-small cell lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer will read out in 2018. The second quarter is always an exciting time with important congresses
This year we will have a strong presence at ASCO
We expect to see the final overall survival data from the CALGB trial with REVLIMID maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
We will also have updated data from the Phase III MAGNIFY trials with (16:47) in relapsed refractory indolent lymphoma
In addition, there will be data from the ABOUND non-small cell lung cancer program with ABRAXANE in elderly patients and in patients with poor performance status
In addition, our collaborations are producing exciting data for ASCO
From our collaboration with bluebird, we will have updated data for the Phase I trial of BB2121 in late line relapsed refractory multiple myeloma
Our collaboration with Juno will see updated data from the Phase I TRANSCEND trial with JCAR017 in relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
Finally, updated data will be presented from the Phase I/II trial with IDHIFA, or enasidenib, through our Agios collaboration
Those data in relapsed refractory AML patients with an IDH2 mutation are the basis of our ongoing FDA submission
As a reminder, the PDUFA date for IDHIFA is August 30 and our U.S
team is fully prepared for a highly successful launch
Through our Acceleron collaboration, we will have luspatercept data at the MDS Foundation meeting in Valencia, Spain, including Phase II data in early low risk MDS patients who have not received an ESA
We are very pleased with the efficacy of luspatercept in this patient population and are moving forward with the planning for a respective Phase III study in front line low risk MDS
Our ongoing Phase III luspatercept studies in later line low risk MDS and non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia, I expect it to be fully recruited during the second quarter, which represents an acceleration of six months versus original plan with an expected readout of top line results by mid 2018. In summary, we had a great start to the year for the Hematology and Oncology franchise and we are on track to deliver our 2017 guidance
We have already achieved key regulatory and clinical milestones with the approval of REVLIMID as maintenance therapy post autologous stem cell transplantation
We are awaiting the approval of IDHIFA in IDH2 mutant relapsed refractory AML by the end of August
We are on track to submit RVd in NDMM to the FDA by year end and have fully recruited our Phase III OPTIMISMM study of pomalidomide/bortezomib in second and later line multiple myeloma
Finally, our mid and late stage pipeline is making great progress
We are further advancing our pivotal plans for luspatercept in front line low risk MDS and are planning to initiate a Phase II study in myelofibrosis later this year
We are preparing to initiate pivotal programs for multiple additional assets by the end of this year, including marizomib in first line glioblastoma, BB2121 in relapsed refractory myeloma, JCAR017 in relapsed refractory large B-cell lymphoma, CC-122 in relapsed refractory lymphoma, IDHIFA in first line AML and durvalumab in myeloma, MDS and AML
Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Scott
Yeah, thanks for the question
I'll start with BB2121. So what we are going to present to you at ASCO I think is reflecting updated data, not just with more patients at the clinically relevant dose, but then also a longer treatment duration which is going to allow us to look exactly at what you were just mentioning, the durability of the responses
We think that throughout the course of the year, we're going to have sufficient patient in the clinically relevant dose to look in aggregate on safety, efficacy and treatment duration, so that we can, as you say, make a pivotal decision by the end of the year
But I think ASCO will allow us to have a first look on a sufficient number of patients with a clinically meaningful treatment duration
Yeah hi, Cory
So the planning is, and we are responsible for planning the registrational study in Europe
So the planning is to have a distinct study in late-line relapsed refracted diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients
And we will probably have the opportunity to do this as a single-arm study and we will have to do a confirmatory trial afterwards
That's where we are
Yeah thanks, Alethia
So I think there's very good numbers that you saw for our first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter, by the way, both for the U.S
and for Europe were really driven primarily by volume
We had a record number of prescriptions in the U.S
and that's a composite of two things
It's the increase in treatment duration and it's market share increases driven by our NDMM launches
And we have the same phenomenon in Europe
We have a very strong 13% sequential volume growth in Europe in the first quarter and this is really a reflection of the starting stem cell transplantation launch
We have reimbursement in six countries but then also the ongoing non-stem cell transplantation launch where we have reimbursement in 17 European countries
Market share in U.S
and in Europe and in Japan continues to grow and treatment duration continues to grow
And the treatment duration is really driven by a couple of things
I just wanted to say this once again
Of course, the fact that REVLIMID is used in early treatment lines, non-first line, that's helping a lot
There's a lot of appreciation because all the data are pointing to this direction of using REVLIMID until progression
And then of course, you have this phenomenon of triplets which are used in the relapsed refractory setting in U.S
, even starting to be used in the first line setting and that is driving treatment duration
So we have all these factors that help us and we have I think a lot of hope that this very positive trend is going to continue very significantly in the future
Yes, thanks for the questions
And you can expect a lot of creative things from us over the time
I think the starting point is really is taking a kind of a late line population where very little treatment options exist
And please recall the data that we've been showing at the Triple meeting in Munich although early, those quadruple refractory patients, where we obtained complete responses and stringent complete responses
So the starting point is obviously kind of a late line population where you can obtain regulatory approval quickly
That said, I think there's all opportunities then to bring BB2121 up in the treatment
And to your point, an MLV-positive population for example in a first line setting is definitely a population to reflect on, a population with high risk cytogenetic features in a first line setting
That's a population definitely to reflect on
I'm personally convinced that over time autonomous transplant and high dose chemotherapy are not going to stay the mainstay for younger patients
And I think we start to see results that are questioning the role, even in the life of new compounds in multiple myeloma
So I would also think about is then opportunity to take out this treatment modality and recreate it by something absolutely better
I think this is all things we are contemplating on
But the starting point for us is having a dose, having a great efficacy, having a great duration of response
And hopefully we're going get and obtain all these results and then go into well-defined late line populations, get the drug approved and then come up a great clinical development plan
Yeah, hello
So our confidence starts with the fact that we have a PDUFA date and certainly very intensive and very constructive ongoing interactions with regulatory authorities
The fact that we believe that we can actually get an approval with single-arm Phase I/II data comes A, from the strength of the data, and then B, from the medical need out of there and C, from the clear definition of the patient population
And let me just also once again say that we are really excited about this approval because it's the first one that comes from our distributed research model
It comes along with a companion diagnostic that will help us a lot in positioning the drug and getting reimbursement
And then of course, it fits beautifully in the AML pipeline that it's building, not just IDHIFA for us (58:19)
So I think from all angles, that looks great
The initial opportunity for IDHIFA is a bit more limited because if we start in relapsed refractory AML, our first line AML journey has started
We have two trials ongoing
We think the real commercial opportunity that could make this drug a $1 billion drug is coming from the first line data and then also hopefully development plans that we are about to develop
Our launch plans are in place and we are very, very excited about IDHIFA
