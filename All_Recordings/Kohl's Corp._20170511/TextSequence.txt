Thanks, Kevin
Comp sales decreased 2.7% for the quarter
There was relatively dramatic improvement in sales trend over the course of the quarter
February was the most challenging month
However, we were pleased with the significant sales trend improvement during the combined March and April time period, which was down only 1%
Average transaction value increased for the quarter
The increase was driven by a continued increase in average unit retail, which was partially offset by a decrease in units per transaction
Transactions were down, but improved significantly throughout the quarter, with March and April improving almost 600 basis points from February
From a line of business perspective, we saw strength across our active businesses due in large part to the launch of Under Armour, which has exceeded our expectations
Footwear, home and men's outperformed the company, while our women's and accessories businesses continued to be challenging
Kevin will provide more details on the sales results in a few minutes
By region, the warm weather regions, the Southeast, South Central and West, outperformed the cold weather regions, with California being relatively strong
Our gross margin rate improved 83 basis points for the quarter driven by improved inventory management and much lower levels of seasonal carryover
Margin was also positively impacted by improved promotional markdown levels over last year
SG&A decreased 3% to $975 million for the quarter
More importantly, we are able to leverage expenses by two basis points on a 3% decrease in sales
The largest contributors to expense reduction were marketing and store expenses
Marketing spend was positively impacted by not repeating an unproductive event, and through efficiencies gained in our noncustomer facing spend
Stores did an excellent job on productivity and managed through the quarter very well
Depreciation expense was $238 million for the quarter, up $4 million from last year
The increase was driven by higher IT amortization, which was only partially offset by lower store-related depreciation due to store closures
Interest expense decreased $3 million for the quarter
Most of the decrease is due to lower interest on capitalized leases as the portfolio matures
Our income tax rate was 39.2% for the quarter, an increase of 160 basis points over last year
During the quarter, we adopted the new share-based compensation rules as required
These rules require us to recognize income tax benefits and tax efficiencies related to share-based awards as income tax expense rather than as equity on our balance sheet
Given our stock price, the new rules resulted in a higher tax expense
This increase was partially offset by an increase in favorable tax settlements this quarter
We do still expect our annual tax rate to be 37.5%, as indicated at the beginning of the year
For the quarter, net income was $66 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.39. We ended the quarter with $625 million of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $202 million over last year
The increase reflects conservative cash management and continued inventory discipline
We made additional progress on our inventory reduction initiatives during the quarter
Inventory per store decreased 1%, while units per store were 5% lower
Our AP, as a percent of inventory, increased 400 basis points to 37.1% as a result of lower inventory levels and timing of Easter receipts
We continue to believe that inventory will be down low- to mid-single-digits for the year
Capital expenditures were $216 million, almost $40 million higher than last year
Most of the increase was due to spending on our fifth e-commerce fulfillment center, which will open later this year
Weighted average diluted shares and shares outstanding at quarter-end were both 171 million
We repurchased 4 million shares of our stock during the quarter
On Wednesday, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share
The dividend is payable on June 21 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 7. At this time, I will turn the call back over to Kevin, who will provide additional details on our results for the quarter and an update on our key initiatives
I think those were the two things we saw the benefits in Q1. Obviously, the clearance won't benefit us as much as going forward, but we'll continue to see the promotional benefit
And, like I said, we're committed to continue to reduce our inventories throughout the rest of the year, so we'll have that benefit as well
And from an operational effectiveness, I think it's leveraging technology
We continue to make a big investment into IT
We're making a $350 million commitment this year, and that technology is going to help us become more efficient, specifically as we continue to leverage stores, whether it be for the in-store service, for the ship from store, for buy online, pick up in store, but how do we make that process most efficient as it is our biggest expense line on the P&L
Second, we talked about opening up our fifth e-commerce fulfillment center, which is going to be about three times as productive as our current fleet, so we do expect efficiencies to come out of that building, and clearly applying those learnings to our existing fleet as well to continue to get productivity as we grow that side of the business
And I think the other thing, Bob, is on efficiencies, by doing the standard-to-small, it is allowing us to be more profitable within those four walls
We're putting less labor in, we're putting less units in
We have better margins as a result
So that is definitely a way to do it
And as we continue to have opportunistic store resizings, we're doing that as well so we're able to become efficient in those boxes
But having the presence also allows us to have speed to customer, so it gives us the advantage from that perspective because we can be within two days, about 90% of the U.S
through using our store base
I thought it'd be cold shoulders for sure, Bob, I'm disappointed
75 to
I think from a credit standpoint, we continue to see the portfolio perform
I don't think you're going to see it be as big of an increase as you have in the past year, it's kind of leveling out as we're approaching 60% penetration on the card
But from a loss perspective, I think you're referencing others have indicated some deterioration
We haven't seen that
We've actually seen a really healthy portfolio performance from that perspective, so we feel good with where our credit continues to perform
So, for the comp metrics, I think I'd talked about in the scripted part that we did see our ATV continue to be up really driven off of AUR being up pretty consistently to what you'd seen in the past, and UPT offsetting that slightly
And then we talked about traffic is down, but seeing a pretty good improvement in that trajectory
We saw between February and the March/April timeframe, over a 600 basis point improvement
So we're not giving specifics on the metrics, but I think you can kind of see where they've consistently been
But we're seeing that improvement in traffic over March/April, and that's what we're feeling good about as we continue to look for the comps as we move into that down 1% range
I think the other piece in optimized stores is we did test these stores, and we did see that we pulled out the inventory, got a nice margin gain, got SG&A savings, but we had no sales change from it
So, it was really a flat-flat sales impact because we were just taking out the unproductive inventory from the stores, but getting that efficiency from expense perspective and getting the margin lift from that having the markdown liability
It was between February and March and April, almost 900 basis point improvement
So we saw that change
And I think it was we launched Under Armour, and Kevin also spoke to tactics around loyalty, and different promotional and marketing media investments that we made, so I think a lot of that contributed
But seeing that health happen in the non-Kohl's Charge and not just out of the loyalty customer was definitely a positive for the quarter
I think it's the key enabler of our inventory initiative as well
So, as we continue to bring inventories down, it's through the lines of localization
So we're ensuring the productivity of it
As this is now essentially over 80% of our inventory receipts are coming in localized, it's hard to measure, to be honest with you, to say what the lift of localization is
So, I think it's just really a key strategy that's an enabler of how we're going to reduce inventory and grow margin, but I don't know that we're going to be able to give you like here's the lift from it just because it's so widespread at this point
Yeah, I think just in terms of personalization, I think we're in the early innings of it
But what we have from an advantage perspective is the loyalty of our customer
60% of our sales on the card with the Yes2You rewards, even though there's 30 million members, we have a lot of data
So I think as we continue to refine the learnings, the machine learnings, the analytics behind it, that's going to really help us enable personalization and making that investment, which I think is going to be a key differentiator for us as we continue to move forward
Yes
We're down like mid-single-digits in the private proprietary brands
I think digital kind of followed exactly what Kevin talked about
We were a little bit softer in that February timeframe, but really strong March and April
So we continue to see that business grow, I think we said in the mid-teens on the call, so we'll continue to see that move up
And then the stores also did well
Obviously, the non-Kohl's Charge, like we talked about earlier, trend was a big contributor to that
So as we continue to invest, as we talked about loyalty, I think that was one of your questions, and on digital, digital is our number one marketing investment
We see that as very critical to continue to grow, and we'll continue to make those investments
And then loyalty initiatives, we did a lot of testing and we feel like, as we continue to leverage those test results into the balance of the year, we should continue to see momentum through that as well
So we feel excited about the non-KC trend improvement that we saw throughout the quarter because we continue to see performance out of our Kohl's Charge
And so as we continue to see that move forward, we feel pretty good with those results moving forward as well
I think the cuts we're making are in the areas that aren't performing, and we're funding into the areas that are performing
So clearly, our inventory in active is way up because we're going to fund into that
So protecting the sales is always the forefront of those cuts, but then we're reacting to where the business is or isn't appropriately
