Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone
Earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $1.55, which when adjusted for items affecting comparability represents a decline of only 5% compared to Q1 last year
I'll remind you last year's first quarter was the best quarter in the company's history
The year-over-year decline in earnings per share reflects this difficult comparison especially in our Studio and Consumer Products businesses due to the strength of Star Wars and, to a lesser extent, Frozen during the first quarter last year
Parks and Resorts had another strong quarter with 6% revenue growth and operating income growth of 13%, driven by increases and our domestic and international businesses
Results in the quarter include unfavorable impacts totaling about $70 million due to Hurricane Matthew, which disrupted operations at Walt Disney World and resulted in the closure of our parks for about a day and half
And the impact of one week of the winter holiday period falling in Q2 this year, whereas the entire holiday period fell in Q1 last year
We estimate these two items had an adverse impact on the year-over-year growth in operating income of about 7 percentage points
Growth at our domestic operations was driven primarily by higher guest spending across our businesses, partially offset by lower attendance
Attendance at our domestic parks was down 5% in the quarter, reflecting a number of comparability factors: last year's 60th Anniversary celebration at Disneyland Resort, the impact of Hurricane Matthew, and the shift in timing of the winter holiday
We estimate these factors had an adverse impact on the year-over-year change in attendance of about 4 percentage points
We continued to see very healthy spending at our domestic parks
Per capita spending was up 7% on higher admissions and food and beverage spending
Per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 3%, and occupancy was down modestly to 91%
So far this quarter domestic resort reservations are comparable to prior-year levels, while booked rates are up 2%
Growth at our international parks was due to the opening of Shanghai Disney Resort in Q3 of fiscal 2016 and improved results at both Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland
Shanghai Disney Resort is off to a strong start
We continue to make great progress and, as Bob discussed, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing there so far
We feel great about the performance of our Parks business during the first quarter
Segment operating margin was 24.4%, up 150 basis points over last year, and represents the highest margin for this segment since we began consolidating our international parks in 2004 and that's despite an estimated 100 basis point headwind due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and the timing of the winter holiday
At Media Networks, operating income was down 4% in the quarter as growth in Broadcasting was more than offset by decline in Cable
Lower Cable results were driven by a decline at ESPN where higher affiliate revenue was more than offset by an increase in programming and production expenses and a decrease in advertising revenue
Growth in ESPN's programming costs was due to our new NBA agreement and contractual rate increases for NFL programming, partially offset by lower programming costs for College Football due to the timing of the College Football Playoff relative to our fiscal calendar
As you know, this year, ESPN aired only three of the New Year's Six bowl games during the first quarter, whereas it aired all Six games during the first quarter last year
ESPN's ad revenue was down 7% in the quarter
The majority of the decline was due to the shift of the three bowl games out of Q1. So far this quarter, ESPN's ad sales are pacing up compared to last year
At Broadcasting, growth in operating income reflected higher affiliation revenue and lower programming costs at the ABC network
First quarter ad revenue across our Broadcasting business was roughly comparable to last year as higher ad revenue at our own TV stations was offset by lower ad revenue at the ABC network, where higher pricing was more than offset by a decrease in impressions
Quarter-to-date, primetime scatter pricing at the ABC network is running over 25% above upfront levels
Total Media Networks' affiliate revenue was up 4% in the quarter due to growth at both Cable and Broadcasting, as growth in rates was partially offset by lower subscribers and foreign exchange
At Consumer Products and Interactive Media, as anticipated, operating income was down meaningfully in the first quarter, given the record-breaking quarter the segment delivered last year
The decline in operating income was driven by lower results at our merchandise licensing business, as sales of Rogue One, Finding Dory, and Moana merchandise were more than offset by very strong sales of Star Wars and Frozen merchandise in Q1 last year
The strength of Star Wars last year also created a tough comp in our games businesses during Q1, given the success of Star Wars: Battlefront last year and no comparable title this year
Our Studio had another outstanding quarter and continues to deliver on both financial and creative fronts
While operating income was lower in the first quarter compared to last year, keep in mind, Q1 fiscal 2016 was the best quarter ever for the Studio
And Q1 of fiscal 2017 was the second best quarter ever with $842 million in operating income
The decline in operating income was due to lower results in our home entertainment and theatrical businesses
Lower home entertainment results reflected strong catalog unit sales in Q1 last year, particularly the classic Star Wars titles and Frozen compared to Q1 this year
On the theatrical side, Q1 results benefited from the strong performance of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, but that was more than offset by the exceptional performance of Star Wars: The Force Awakens in the first quarter last year
During the first quarter, we repurchased about 15 million shares for about $1.5 billion
Fiscal year-to-date, we've repurchased 22.2 million shares for approximately $2.2 billion
And as we've mentioned previously, we intend to repurchase between $7 billion and $8 billion for the year
As we look to the second quarter, there are a couple of comparability items I want to highlight
At ESPN, the shift of the three College Football Playoff games into Q2 will drive an increase in ESPN's programming costs compared to Q2 last year
Additionally, ESPN's programming costs will continue to reflect the first year of its new NBA rights deal
In total, we estimate cable programming and production costs will be up about 16% in the second quarter
And that's in line with our expectation for an 8% increase for the full year
At Parks and Resorts, Q2 results will benefit from one week of the winter holiday shifting into the quarter
However, the timing of the Easter holiday will negatively impact Q2 results, as this holiday period will fall entirely in Q3 this year, whereas it fell in Q2 last year
We estimate these two shifts will have a net adverse impact of about $50 million to operating income
And at the Studio, while we are incredibly excited for the release of Beauty and the Beast, I want to remind everyone, it will be our only release in the quarter
So Studio results will once again face a tough comparison to a very strong second quarter last year, which benefited from the strength of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the release of Zootopia
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results and with the start of the fiscal year
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Lowell for Q&A
Hi, Alexia
I think the best way look at Consumer Products is we had given you the outlook that they were going to be down for this first fiscal quarter, and they in fact were
But we expected them to have growth for the year, but most of that would be back end loaded
So you should expect growth year-over-year for the second half, both third quarter and fourth quarter
The properties that are really going to contribute to that are going to be Cars and Spider-Man, and we expect that to be a strong back half of the year for Consumer Products
The Parks, as you saw the margin, in my comments, 24.4% operating margin
That's not only for the domestic operations, but that's for the global segment
So they've done a really good job on many fronts
And very importantly is their cost control
That's been through ongoing cost initiatives throughout their businesses
And they've offset the normal increases that we would get through inflation and wage increases
So I think you can expect continued cost management in the Parks and continued strong margins
Anthony, on your drivers of the affiliate revenue in the quarter, as I said in my comments, the affiliate revenue growth was 4%
That was â€“ rates impacted it by 7%
Subs were a two-point drag, and FX was a one point drag
And that's for Media Networks overall
And these trends are consistent with the trends that we've had in recent quarters, so it's really no change
On advertising, as it relates ESPN, the ad revenue was down 7% in the quarter
The biggest driver of that was the shift in the College Football Playoff games three into 2Q
You also had some ratings decline in SportsCenter, and that was in part due to fewer programming hours for SportsCenter
And also when talked about this last conference call for earnings was declines in Monday Night Football ratings
But when you look at 2Q pacings, they're up even when you adjust for the College Football Playoff, which did have the most significant impact in 1Q
So, Todd, to answer your question on pension
As you saw the first page of our press release in the first table we showed cash from operations
You saw it down pretty significantly from a year ago
But if you account for that, if you adjust for the $1.3 billion of pension contribution that we made in the quarter, it more than offsets that decline
You mentioned rising rates
And rising rates will definitely benefit our pension going forward
In our 10-Q we â€“ I believe the 10-Q had explicitly stated that for each 100 basis point increase in the discount rate, our pension liability would decrease by about $2.4 billion
So that being said, rising rates are certainly going to benefit us
As it relates to pension expense for the year, we don't expect to change from what we had talked about in our last conference call
And after this $1.3 billion that we put in, in the first quarter, there shouldn't be any meaningful contributions for the balance of the year
Yeah, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is over 25% above upfront
Okay
On the parks, as you noted, we did have a lot of comparability factors and once again there is a lapping of the 60th, the Hurricane Matthew, and also the impact of the shift of holiday periods
We also, as was noted previously in the call, we did introduce seasonal pricing a year ago and we are seeing some shift in some of our demand to try to smooth attendance over those peak demand periods
So I don't think you should read too much into the attendance
Over the same period that you're noting, we've also seen strong increases in per cap spending
It was up 7% in the quarter, which we gave you
And so that's more than offset the impact of the attendance decline
And we also have some new offerings, as Bob mentioned, Avatar, there's also Guardians of the Galaxy coming this summer at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim
So we think these new offerings are going to stimulate future demand and I don't think you should read too much into this one quarter
On the change in payables, that decline is related to the pension plan contribution of $1.3 billion
