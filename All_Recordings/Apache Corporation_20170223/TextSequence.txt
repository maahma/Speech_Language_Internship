Good afternoon and thank you for joining us
On today's call, I will review our 2016 accomplishments, outline our 2017 strategic and operational objectives, discuss our capital spending plans and production outlook for the next two years, and I will conclude with an update of our Alpine High play
First, I'd like to step back and take stock of the last two years and how we have repositioned Apache
The collapse in commodity prices which began in 2014 required a strategic response to improve the company's financial standing and our operational capabilities and to position Apache to thrive as prices recovered
We have accomplished all that and more
The cornerstone of our approach has been strict capital discipline and cost structure rationalization, both of which have significantly improved the quality and economics of our underlying inventory as well as our ability to access and exploit its value for the future
We accomplished this through a rigorous and more centralized process for capital allocation, a more detailed long-term planning process, and through significant cost reductions in our operations and in our overhead structure
For example, we significantly reduced activity Onshore North America where costs were not aligned with lower commodity prices, dropping from 91 rigs in the third quarter of 2014 to eight rigs at year-end 2016. And since 2014, we drove down average onshore well costs by 30% to 40% across key plays in North America
Our LOE per BOE is down 24% and we have reduced our gross overhead cost structure by more than $300 million
As a result of these efforts, we were able to preserve our dividend, avoid issuing equity and maintain our investment-grade rating
We are now well prepared for a more constructive, albeit lower price environment, than prior to the downturn
With the proven quality of our Midland Basin acreage and the recent addition of the Alpine High in the Delaware Basin, we have an inventory capable of delivering robust organic growth for many years
Though some commodity price softness may continue, we are comfortable increasing our capital investment, which will leverage the quality of our inventory and the progress we have made on costs over the last two years
Now let me recount some of our key 2016 accomplishments
This was an exceptional year for Apache and another step forward in the positive transformation of the company
We exceeded our original production target, significantly lowered our cost structure and discovered an enormous new resource play in the Delaware Basin at Alpine High
Our operational improvements and exploration successes have positioned the company to deliver returns-focused growth for many years to come
On this call last year, I outlined a series of strategic and operational objectives designed to guide the company through a potentially lower-for-longer commodity price environment
We delivered on all of them
Most notably, we focused our North American capital on strategic testing and completion optimization, and in doing so, significantly expanded our economic drilling inventory and demonstrated our ability to deliver well results better than offset operators
We worked to streamline our North American portfolio through new acreage leasing, trades, and sales
We now have a more concentrated and contiguous position in the Permian Basin
We continued to drive cost efficiencies throughout the organization and achieved a 16% reduction in LOE per BOE from 2015 and we began the year with a conservative budget, which enabled us to increase activity levels late in the year as commodity prices improved
All of these efforts were necessary to position Apache for a strengthening commodity price environment
Our long-term focus has consistently been on delivering fully burdened returns-focused growth
In the lower commodity price environment, allocating capital toward our free cash flow positive assets in the UK, North Sea and Egypt while investing in exploration was the optimal use of our capital
As commodity prices strengthened, deploying a greater proportion of our capital into developing our world-class Onshore North American assets, is better
Our objective going forward will be to deliver returns-focused growth and our plan to support this objective includes: budgeting conservatively and maintaining flexibility to accelerate activity, if warranted; continuing our focus on costs and well optimization to maintain the structural efficiencies achieved over the last two years; increasing capital allocation to the Midland and Delaware Basins, where we have an extensive high quality inventory; initiating an optimized development program at Alpine High; investing to sustain long-term free cash flow generation from Egypt and the North Sea; and, finally, actively managing our portfolio and redeploying capital to higher-value opportunities
Now I'll turn to the 2017-2018 capital budget
Our capital budget for this year is $3.1 billion, which is up more than 60% from 2016. Our 2017 plan assumes $50 per barrel WTI, $51 per barrel for Brent index crude, $3.15 per Mcf for NYMEX natural gas, and $5.25 per Mcf for UK indexed gas
At these price levels, our capital program will exceed anticipated operating cash flow
The gap will be covered by proceeds from non-core asset sales, $400 million of which has already occurred, and a realization of prices at the current strip
We have also put in place some oil price hedges to protect against downside price movements
Steve will cover these in more detail
Our 2017 capital plan allocates nearly two-thirds or $2 billion to the Permian Basin
Of this amount, 90% will be directed to the Midland and Delaware Basins
This includes approximately $500 million for infrastructure construction at Alpine High, which will fund multiple pipeline connections along with the necessary compression, gathering, centralized processing facilities and tank batteries that will more than accommodate our planned volume ramp
Internationally, we will invest to sustain long-term free cash flow generation in Egypt and the North Sea
Total international spending represents approximately $900 million or 29% of our 2017 budget, split fairly evenly between Egypt and the North Sea
We have also included $37 million for an exploration well in Suriname, which we expect to spud next week
Outside of Suriname, our 2017 international opportunity set is primarily focused on development drilling and lower risk step-out exploration, where we have a long-standing track record of success
We are particularly excited about two exploration concessions that we recently received in the Western Desert of Egypt, our first award there in over 10 years
Should commodity prices further improve during the year and cash flows allow, incremental capital will be allocated primarily to the Midland and Delaware Basins
Turning briefly to 2018, our preliminary capital outlook is for $3.2 billion in investment
This program is supported by anticipated volume growth and higher plan prices for 2018. Like 2017, our 2018 plan will be heavily weighted toward Permian investment
Our 2017 and 2018 plan capital program will initiate a significant and prolonged production growth ramp
I would note specifically the magnitude of our anticipated production growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins
To assist in the production outlook discussion, we have provided a series of slides on pages 22 to 26 in our financial and operational review issued this morning with our earnings results
This includes a production forecast through the end of 2018. While our capital program has increased to reflect the objective of delivering long-term returns-focused growth, our production response will have a brief lag before transitioning to a strong growth trajectory
We anticipate total production will decline to approximately 372,000 BOEs to 384,000 BOEs per day in the second quarter of 2017. This will be a result of three primary drivers
In preparation for the start-up of our Callater discovery in the third quarter of 2017, we have accelerated our annual North Sea maintenance turnarounds into the second quarter
These turnarounds would typically occur later in the year
We have significant gas plant maintenance downtime scheduled in Canada for the second quarter of 2017 and investment in our lowest-margin North American assets was severely curtailed over the last two years and these assets are currently in decline
Importantly, none of this projected decline is in our higher-margin Midland Basin production, despite very low activity levels last year
In the second half of the year, the North Sea should rebound sharply with the start-up of Callater
More notably, North America will begin a rapid and relatively consistent quarterly growth ramp, which should continue through the end of 2018 and beyond
This will be driven primarily by the combination of accelerating oil production in the Midland Basin and the start-up of Alpine High in the Delaware Basin
Our projected oil growth in the Midland Basin is underpinned by the impressive performance we are seeing in our most recent vintage wells
Tim Sullivan will provide more detail on our Midland Basin wells in his remarks
At Alpine High, we anticipate having our first major sales line connection by July
Well connections and facilities commissioning will take place through the end of the year, accompanied by a material ramp in wet gas production
To put some numbers around our two-year growth profile, we expect total company production to increase by approximately 10% annually from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2018. Our Midland and Delaware Basin assets are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 50% over the same time and drive the vast majority of Apache's overall production increase
Oil production growth in the Midland and Delaware will also be very strong with an annual growth rate of approximately 18%
We're very confident that Apache's portfolio can deliver on our production expectations through the end of 2018 and beyond
We are seeing outstanding drilling results in the Midland Basin and Alpine High continues to surprise us to the upside
With that, I will conclude with a brief update on the Alpine High play and review our next steps as we begin to phase in well optimization and fuel development activities
Since first announcing Alpine High last September, we have made tremendous progress delineating the play
We have confirmed several things thus far
We have an extensive play fairway, which spans 55 miles and a 5,000 foot vertical column encompassing five geologic formations, each with multiple targets
The hydrocarbon phase of this column ranges from dry gas to wet gas to oil
The entire Alpine High fairway is over-pressured with higher pressure gradients to the north and to the south
We have a second landing zone in the Woodford formation and most likely a third
We have productivity in the Pennsylvanian formation
And in the southern portion of the play, we have encountered the entire hydrocarbon column, improving productivity in the Woodford
With these results, we now believe that Alpine High's resource and location count has increased significantly since last September
And we haven't changed our view on well economics
We will provide updates to these numbers in the future
Importantly, we are beginning to optimize our wells using customized zone targeting, larger fracs and, in some cases, longer laterals
Combined with multi-well pad drilling we are confident this will demonstrate the economic value of the wet gas interval of Alpine High over the coming months
We continue to refer to Alpine High is a wet gas play, because that is what we have confirmed thus far
As we have previously noted, we are delineating from the bottom-up and this process is not yet complete
This is a prolific wet gas play from which we expect a minimum of 3,000 drillable locations
A significant enhancement to the economics of the source rock interval at Alpine High is the lack of water in the target formations
Once these wells produce the frac load, water production declined sharply, which results in significantly lower operating costs
Additionally, the field development program is not constrained by the need for extensive water handling infrastructure
As a result, even in the lower commodity price environment, this play is going to be very economic
Turning to midstream and marketing, our efforts at Alpine High are advancing quickly
Because the play lies in an area with very little existing infrastructure, it provides the unique opportunity to design a greenfield fit-for-purpose system that optimizes processing and transportation of our production and will service Alpine High for the full life of the field
For now, we own 100% of the midstream as it allows us to control the pace and scope of the build out
Alpine High is ideally situated with three major transportation lines located within 10 miles to the north and one major line to the south
The Waha hub which is located roughly 45 miles east of our acreage provides additional options for access to a wide range of domestic markets
Our location places us at the front of the line to deliver gas to Mexico as well as being advantageously positioned with LNG and petrochemical markets on the Texas Gulf Coast
Contract negotiations are well underway, and we see no near-term takeaway constraints as we prepare for first gas and the follow-on production ramp
On the marketing front, we have been inundated with interest for both our natural gas and NGLs
Potential customers are looking for certainty of supply, and the thick hydrocarbon bearing zones at Alpine High can provide it
In conclusion, Apache begins 2017 with an excellent opportunity set
Momentum will start to build around mid-year, with increased contribution from our pad drilling in the Midland Basin and the commencement of first residue gas sales at Alpine High
The Permian Basin will clearly be the driver of strong growth in the second half of 2017 through 2018 and well into the future
While commodity price volatility may not be completely behind us, we have come through the downturn with a very strong financial position and the ability to fund future growth through cash flow and portfolio high-grade
We continue to have no desire to add leverage or dilute our equity holders
Over the last two years, Apache demonstrated that we can play very good defense, and we now look forward to showing you our offense
With the plans, we have in place, we believe we will deliver highly competitive returns and top-tier Permian-driven growth
I will now turn the call over to Tim
No, John, I mean, we took time and, really over the last two years, worked on our programs
We focused on targeting there, we did a lot of core work and really zoned in on where do we want to be landing the wells
I can tell you, in general, we went back to higher fluid volumes
They are more stage numbers they're closer together and we actually reduced our sand concentration significantly, so it really is part of the optimization process
We're very excited about the results and since we're flowing back in pads versus one well per section, we're very confident in those results and it's really attributable to the work that the team's done at the detail level in integrating core into the completion optimization process
I mean, I think right now, most of it will be priced off of Waha, is how we're thinking about it
We're very early
The thing I think that we've seen is that on the longer-term view there is a need out there for supply and so I think we'll have some optionality and we're really starting to think about that and think longer-term with larger volumes
Well, thanks, Ed
I'd say first and foremost, we've been drilling kind of cookie-cutter wells that are designed to test the rock in the stratigraphy
I think the important piece of information we brought forward was the overpressure to the south
In fact, now, if you look at the pressure gradient across the whole play in the bottom zone, it's all lower pressure
Clearly, as we move to the far northwest, you're deeper and there's even more overpressure
But as we look back, the one well we disclosed, a couple of different wells, but the Hidalgo well actually, we believe, we had to spud that well before we had the 3-D in
And we believe it is drilled
In fact, we now know it's not on the proper azimuth
We've got a couple of wells coming that we're excited about that will be on the proper azimuth
But what was impressive to us was how flat the well has been
It leveled off and hasn't budged and the water is continuing to come down
So, we're very impressed with it
The pressure gradients were higher and the thing that we've been able to see is the entire column as well
So, if you look back, the process we've taken, the very first Woodford wells were all in the middle part of the section
We've now validated there's a stronger upper zone
We believe there's a third landing zone as well on the lower, which would give you three landing zones in the Woodford alone
And if I take you back to the Barclays disclosure in September last year, we really assigned just one landing zone on part of our acreage to the Woodford and the Barnett
So, I know everybody wanted big flow rates
We don't have the processing facilities in place yet to do that
We are under flaring rules and so drilling longer laterals with bigger fracs right now is just not the optimal use of our dollars
But, we are moving into a phase where we have line of sight now on connection to the gas markets, where we can start to stretch some things out and actually start to demonstrate what we know this rock will do
So, we're very excited to be shifting gears as we start into the optimization process, but bottom line on it is that there are many, many landing zones, a vast resource, and we're excited about the potential across the whole hydro-column, all the way from the dry gas to the wet gas up into the oil zones, which we're about to get to
The last thing I'll say, I was at your conference last week, we said we have eight wells that are currently in process that will be targeting shallower zones from 9,500 to 11,000 feet
So, we know the gas gets richer and the liquids content is going to go up and we do anticipate seeing some oil as well
So, we're excited
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC And then we're all watching the data, but the other big item obviously is getting this pipe in place, maybe just an update on the progress in terms of getting the infrastructure in place to be able to flow these wells a little bit more optimally?
Well, we've got July circled on the calendar and
Edward George Westlake - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC July 4?
we're obviously on a path to get there and the way we give guidance and things, I would expect we'd be able to make what we've told you we'd be able to do
No, Scott, I mean, if you look at the well, still a lot of load coming back
I mean, most of these wells we've moved ESPs in early to get the water off of them
You see a trend on that well that's coming down
As I mentioned, it's not on the optimal azimuth, and we've seen that in some of the wells in the other parts of the play
Getting them on the right azimuth will make a difference as well
But, we're absolutely thrilled with the well and think when you start to look at the curve and realize that really from about day 33 on through we're now over 100 days, the thing has not budged
The oil's been slowly coming down, and it is cutting a little bit of oil with it as well
So, we're very excited about it
I will reiterate, this is only a 3,300 foot lateral and we had a limited number of frac stages in the small frac
And it's not on the optimal azimuth
Well, there are different areas in terms of how the wells flow back
A lot of the wells we've run subs in early they get the water off of them
We've got some instances where they haven't needed them
And I think the different azimuth will relate to a different profile on the water, higher IP, and obviously we think the productivity is going to go up when we optimize the frac
So, I think it will change the shape and the IP capacity of the well and so forth more than anything
Bob, at this point, it's a well we're very excited about; Block 53 we own 45% of
We've got two partners in there
The rig is on its way to location now, as we speak
We should be spudding it probably late next week
As Tim said in his prepared remarks, it's probably a 70-days, 10-week type well
I'll say it's an exploration well
It's a well we need to drill
We're excited about it
And that's all we've really disclosed on it
I will also tell you we're working the 3-D on Block 58, which we have 100%, we're really thrilled about as well
So, if I had my druthers, I might be drilling 58 first, but the timing is the opposite
But we're very excited about the Kolibri (46:41) prospect and we'll come back with the results in 70 days, 80 days, roughly
It is a strat trap
Thank you
Hey, Brian
Well, what I would say, Brian, is overall our North American decline rates probably on average about 20%
It's come down significantly over the last two years as we have not been investing in a lot of those projects and plays
It's about where it would sit now
Some areas are a little heavier, some areas are a little lighter; but in general, that's kind of where that overall base decline rate would be today
As we start to go back to work in some of the other areas, we'll be bringing on some higher decline stuff and it'll start to trend back in the future
With the international, depending like you're seeing, we pulled the third quarter turnaround in the North Sea after the second quarter, so it's going to be lumpy at times
We see relatively flat for our international over the next couple years
The one thing that drives Egypt is the price and the way the production sharing contracts work, so you're seeing our nets come down a little bit as prices started to improve late last year
And that's going to have a little bit of an impact as we look into the out years as depending on price, but pretty stable
Arun, it is and it's also at the $50 price deck
So, what we state in there was with the sales that we have already in the house, over $400 million and with where strips would be today, that would cover dividend and everything
Well, what we've done, Arun, we gave you a corporate level numbers
We showed you kind of a North American production outlook and then we really broke down the key driver, which is Midland, Delaware
We showed you an overall number and we've showed you the oil piece
What we did not show you is the liquid yield on the gas and, quite frankly, Alpine is going to be the driver there
And the big thing is by July of this year, we'll have facilities up and running
We can come back then and start to update the NGL yields and some of those things
I'll also tell you that given the program we have today, which is more wet gas driven with a lot of tests in the oil zone still yet to come, we've got a pretty conservative mix dialed in
So, there's a good chance you get out to 2018 or even later this year where we will be updating those and giving more color
But we didn't want to get into that until we really had the facilities up and running and could really shed some light on the NGLs
And, quite frankly, we've got a lot of well still yet to test that can make things oilier
Well, the answer is absolutely, David
I mean that's kind of the model we've taken
We did see the pumping pressure go up in December
If you look at our overall well costs – and I can have Tim give some more color in just a second to kind of add on to what I'll say here
We have forecasted some inflation in total, probably around 10%
What we don't have dialed in is efficiencies
I think areas like Alpine High where we're still very early we've got a lot of room to move on the efficiency curve as we get in to drill these things
Quite frankly, a few of the laterals that we drilled in the upper zones, we were surprised that the pressure gradients were higher and we had to run some shorter laterals than we had originally planned
So, as we learn those you're going to see things come down, but we've unbundled
Tim pointed out in his comments there that we've done some things, the frac crews, where we've indexed some portions with commodity price
So, we're trying to get creative on how to make it really a win-win as we work through this
But absolutely, still unbundling, very confident in where our cost structure is
We've secured most of our services for the next couple years
So we feel good about what we've got in our numbers
Is there anything you want to add, Tim?
There is a little bit, David
I mean, it's a cash cow for us
It's why we split it out from the numbers in terms of where the growth investment is
We're excited about – I mean we remain optimistic and excited about the Central Basin Platform
Quite frankly, with more cash flow, there's more projects to do there
But there are things we don't have to do
And so there's a fine line of balancing
One of the things that we should be doing versus what you can be doing
But we've got slight decline there
It's much lower than the North American numbers that I gave, well under 10% on average, and it's a significant source of volume and cash flow for us
After Egypt – Egypt, Central Basin Platform and North Sea are really the three cash drivers – cash flow generators for the corporation right now
So, an important part of our portfolio and the nice thing about it is the longevity
Well, I mean, Jeff, it is built into that forecast right now
We roped it in
Now, I'll tell you, like we always do, we're going to guide in things that we feel like we can deliver
So, it's not our Permian
That's just the Midland and Delaware
So, I think there were a few folks that got that mixed up this morning in their notes and forgot that we've got 72,000 BOEs a day on the Central Basin Platform, but that is just the Midland and Delaware Basin curves
It does have Alpine in it
I think it is a good look, conservative look for us for right now and it's liable to get stronger and liable to get more oily
But I'll leave it
For right now, that's what we put out
Well, that's going to be predominantly our Canadian assets and what we call our Houston region, which would be our conventional Anadarko and our Eagle Ford assets
So that's heavily influenced by Canada as well as the – I think we've got Guam in there as well, but just a much smaller volume
Well, I mean, at this point, we have not provided updates, Charles, on either of those wells
We are in the area where we were seeing the DST
What I'll also tell you, though, is we had a lot of open hole above us and that's where we, obviously, took a big pressure kick
We let it flow, flowed for about 10 days, was making 700 oil
But we had a lot of column above us
And we showed in the Credit Suisse package that we thought that was probably in a more gassy regime
So we will see
There's a good chance that oil may be coming from some of the up hole zones that also look fantastic as well
But you know, the DST, you had open column but that is where the tool was when we took the kick
So, still to be determined as we delineate and get to that
The other thing I would say there is if we've got more cash flow, that's going to be one of the first areas that you can see us pick up some more rigs and activity
I mean, Midland, Delaware are going to be the areas that you'll see, you know, if prices were to move up, we have more cash flow, that's where you'd see us accelerating
Well, Paul, I mean, I think if you lay out, we spent $200 million last year, we've laid out $500 million the next two years
We're very excited
I mean, the first two phases of this are going to take us several years in
We won't have a decision point to make on staying with re-fridge, which is kind of the base case we have in the field right now, or do we go to cryo? But as I said on the earnings call last August, we're not talking hundreds of millions of cubic feet of gas here a day, we're talking multiple Bcfs, a very rich gas, wet gas, NGLs, and we think there's going to be also a lot of oil to go with it
So, we're very excited about what we have in front of us
I think once we are able to get the processing equipment in the field and things running, you'll start to see some things in terms of lateral lengths, optimized fracs, and we'll start to show you really what this resource is capable of doing
So, we're very excited about it, and I think it's going to be a big underpinning item for Apache and our Permian for a long, long time
And what I'll say, Paul, is just look at what we've given you
We've given you now a look into the end of 2018. I've said, it's likely conservative on what Alpine and what our Permian can do
We gave you some location counts at Barclays
We've come back now and said we've got a minimum of 3,000 confirmed locations in the wet gas window
We will unfold more as it continues to progress, but we remain very optimistic, very excited
But one thing I'll say about this field is it gets bigger
I know there was a little bit of a negative reaction to some of the rates, because everybody's expecting us to be optimizing and scaling-up our fracs and things, but we're very pleased with where we are, and the scope and scale of this field has done nothing but get bigger since our initial disclosure in September of last year
Yeah, most of that, we're now got 1.5 mile to two miles dialed in
We did a lot of work over the last two years buttoning down some trades
So most of the wells we're going to be drilling are 1.5 mile to two mile laterals now
So, we're excited about that as well
