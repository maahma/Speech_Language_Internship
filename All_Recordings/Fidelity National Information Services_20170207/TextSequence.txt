Thanks, Gary
I will begin on slide 9 with a summary of our consolidated results for the quarter and for the full year of 2016. Today, consistent with our prior 2016 earnings announcements, all adjusted numbers and calculations are on an adjusted combined basis, as if SunGard was owned in both periods
In the fourth quarter, revenue increased 4.8% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $846 million, a 15.2% increase compared to the prior year
Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations was $377 million and adjusted earnings per share increased 22.6% to $1.14 per share
For the year, revenue increased 4.6% on an organic basis and EBITDA grew to $2.9 billion, an 11.1% increase compared to the prior-year period
EBITDA margin expanded 220 basis points to 31.2%, and adjusted earnings per share grew 18.6% to $3.82 per share
We finished the year marginally exceeding our run rate synergy goal of $200 million for 2016. Moving to slide 10. In the four quarter, IFS revenue grew on an organic basis by 2.5%, while EBITDA grew 5%, primarily driven by a favorable shift in revenue mix, coupled with executing ongoing cost management initiatives
For full-year 2016, IFS revenue increased 5% on an organic basis and EBITDA increased 4.2% compared to the prior-year period
Adjusting for the absence of incentive accruals discussed in the prior quarter, EBITDA would've increased 5.7% for the year, reflecting margin expansion of 20 basis points on an apples-to-apples basis
Turning to slide 11. Banking and Wealth was relatively flat for the quarter
This was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the completion of the previously disclosed professional services project
Absent this, the IP-led product business grew approximately 3%
Payments grew 1.1% for the quarter
As we've discussed previously, EMV growth comparables will become more difficult in the second half of the year
We issued 7 million EMV cards in the quarter
When combined with the previous quarter's EMV results, approximately 50% of our clients are EMV-enabled
As we've discussed previously, we expect the remainder of cards to be EMV-enabled in a natural reissuance cycle as they expire
Corporate and digital produced growth of 12.5% for the quarter
This growth was driven primarily by strong sales for corporate liquidity and continued double-digit revenue growth in digital solutions
In addition to the large contract Gary mentioned, our corporate liquidity solutions had strong license revenue, contributing to the growth
As discussed in prior quarters, we did not expect IFS results in the second half of the year to replicate the exceptional growth in the first half of the year
We are pleased with the organic growth of 5%, and profitability results for the year
Turning to slide 12. In the fourth quarter, GFS revenue grew 7.7% organically while EBITDA grew 31.3%
For the quarter, this represents 700 basis points of margin expansion to 36%
For full-year 2016, revenue increased 5% organically
EBITDA grew 17.2% compared to the prior year, reflecting 380 basis points of margin expansion to 30.4%
This was driven by higher margin product sales and cost synergies
2016 margin results exceeded our expectations and marked an important milestone for the SunGard transaction
As we outlined in previous calls, we expected to exceed 30% margins over time in this segment
We're very pleased to complete 2016 at just over 30%, which was faster than anticipated
As discussed earlier this year, the GFS segment has shown significant structural improvement as a result of the SunGard acquisition, which improved the revenue quality, increasing the amount of revenue tied to recurring IP-led solutions
This improved revenue mix and the execution of our integration plan contributed to significant margin expansion in the segment
As discussed in May, we continue to expect margin expansion of 100 basis points to 150 basis points annually for the segment
Moving to slide 13. Our Institutional and Wholesale business grew 8.7% for the quarter, driven by buy-side and risk and compliance solutions
This result aligns with our previous commentary related to quarterly seasonality for this business, which has heavier sales activity in the fourth quarter
Banking and Payments grew 2.5% organically
Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased card processing volumes in Brazil and payment strength in Australia, resulting from completion of a client conversion in the quarter
Consulting results for the quarter were in line with our expectations of double-digit growth, primarily driven by easy comparables to the prior year quarter
As we discussed throughout 2016, we continue to see softness in discretionary spending going into 2017. Macroeconomic events during 2016 such as Brexit and the U.S
elections have not altered our expectations of continuing softness and demand for people-based services at this time
Moving to slide 14. Corporate and Other revenue for the fourth quarter was $159 million, with an EBITDA loss of $44 million
The Corporate and Other segment results include $88 million of Corporate expenses for the quarter, compared to $77 million in the prior year period
The increase was driven primarily by higher incentive accruals in the quarter
Moving to slide 15. Our business model continues to generate significant cash flow
Free cash flow was $435 million for the quarter and $1.5 billion for the year
In the fourth quarter, our free cash flow conversion to adjusted net earnings was 115%
We reduced our debt by approximately $1 billion in 2016, and had approximately $10.5 billion of debt outstanding as of December 31. In 2016, we returned $341 million in dividends and ended the year with weighted average shares outstanding of 330 million on a fully diluted basis
In line with our previous guidance, the effective tax rate was 35% for the quarter and full year
Turning to slide 16. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to sell our public sector and education businesses
As we recently announced, the transaction closed on February 1, 2017. Based on the timing of the close, this transaction created a $0.13 adjusted EPS headwind for 2017, net of interest expense savings
For the purposes of modeling, full-year 2016 EBITDA for PS&E, was approximately $80 million
The transaction produced approximately $500 million of net cash proceeds, which was used to pay down debt
We also announced we will redeem our $700 million, 5% interest senior notes due 2022. The redemption of these notes accelerates our deleveraging efforts and reduces our interest expense
We anticipate using free cash flow in 2017 to eliminate all our remaining prepayable debt, reducing our outstanding debt below $9 billion by the end of the year
Finally, due to our 2016 performance, we recently announced a 12% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share
Looking forward to 2017, due to the strategic nature and scale of the IFS and GFS segments, I would like to provide some additional color on segment drivers, which guided our planning process for the year
We are also providing guidance on IFS and GFS revenue growth in 2017. IFS will continue to serve our U.S
market, consolidating at the higher end of its historical trends
We also continue to see aggressive competition across all our solutions
These factors are driving us to the lower end of IFS long-term organic revenue guidance
GFS will continue to see strong growth in institutional and wholesale, and an improvement in our Banking and Payment Solutions
We expect single-digit growth for our consulting services for the full year
Specific to the first quarter of 2017, both IFS and GFS faced difficult comparisons, primarily driven by a previously discussed people-based project, and the anniversary of accelerated EMV card production in IFS, and a large license renewal in GFS
For the full year, Corporate and Other segment, which houses our non-strategic assets, we created approximately 1% top line headwind to consolidated organic revenue growth
This decline is primarily driven by a loss of the client, who was acquired in late 2016, continuing decline in check volumes at the point of sale, and loss attributed to the planned divestiture of the public and sector (sic) [sector and] (19:31) education revenue growth
To be clear, organic growth is adjusted for the divestiture of PS&E, but the loss of higher growth from this business will be a headwind during the year
Finally, in addition to our debt payments and dividends, we expect to generate excess cash in 2017. This will create flexibility for other cash uses beginning in late 2017 and into 2018, including, but not limited to, share buybacks
Turning to slide 17. For 2017, we expect consolidated organic revenue growth of 2% to 3%, IFS organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%, GFS organic revenue growth of 4% to 5%
Consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $3.04 billion to $3.12 billion, implying reported growth of 3% to 6%, or 6% to 9% adjusting for the impact of the PS&E divestiture
Adjusted earnings per share of $4.15 to $4.30 per share representing growth of 9% to 13%, or 12% to 16% adjusted for the impact of the PS&E divestiture and does not include any share buybacks
Finally, exiting the year with a cost synergy run rate in excess of $275 million, an increase from our previous target of $250 million
Similar to last year, we have also provided additional assumptions to better assist your modeling efforts for the year
These are found in the appendix of today's presentation
Of note, I would like to call out our effective tax rate assumption for the year, which is 32%
This 300 basis point reduction from the prior year period is driven by efficient tax planning strategies, growth in lower tax geographies, and the impact from changes in accounting treatment of stock-based compensation
Current consensus estimates do not fully reflect the impact of the public sector and education divestiture
Further, to help with modeling, the quarterly spread of our expectations for 2017, we expect first quarter adjusted EPS in the range of $0.81 to $0.83. For fourth quarter of 2017, our expectations are up to $0.05 per share above current consensus estimates
This reflects the full-year impact of the divestiture of PS&E, the previously discussed grower risk (21:54) in IFS and GFS in the first quarter, as well as higher seasonality in the fourth quarter and timing of synergies
Similar to last year, we have a conservative view on the overall macro conditions and have not assumed any improvements in conditions in the markets we serve
We are confident in our guidance for the year and our ability to continue to drive value to our shareholders through compelling business model and strong cash flow generation
That concludes our prepared remarks
Operator, you now may open the line for questions
Question-and-Answer Session
Good morning, Dave
Yes, that sits in the Corporate and Other segment
It was a commercial services customer, David
The impact to consolidated organic growth is about a point with a combination of that loss and declining check volumes in that segment
The IFS and GFS segments were not affected by this
Again, their growth being in line with what we talked about back in May
And there was a relatively small term fee associated with the transaction
Thanks, David
That's correct, Dave
It overall is a drag on total company organic growth in that zone
Yeah, a couple of things
One, I tried to highlight the components of what's driving it
Of the 300 basis point reduction, about 1 point or 100 basis points is really driven by the accounting change in stock comp, where everybody should get some level of benefit there
200 points is really driven off of tax planning strategies and lower rate geographies
It can continue to go down in the current environment, as we continue to work through tax planning strategies, and as our international revenue base continues to grow
You've got three moving parts around reported to organic
You've got the $9.2 billion base you're talking about
If you remember, we had a deferred revenue acquisition adjustment around SunGard of about $200 million
We've got expectations of around $75 million of currency impact being a negative, and then the PS&E sale being about 3 points and that would drive you from reported of 1% to 2% to organic of 2% to 3%
As we talked about in May, we really gave 3% to 7% organic revenue guide over the horizon, with 13% to 18% earnings per share growth
I would not anticipate changing that guide
We do have an adjustment associated with PS&E
But the individual earnings per share growth per year we think is very close to that
If you adjust out PS&E this year, you're in 12% to 16% underlying growth in the business
Yeah, if you remember specifically, we tried to give you an implied number associate, but we're trying to give percentage growth over that horizon
It will be difficult to get to that full $4.70 number, Ashwin, with the sale of PS&E, but we do anticipate in that 13% to 18% EPS growth
It will be difficult to get to a $4.70 number with the sale of PS&E
The growth, we believe, will be in the 13% to 18% range for 2018.
Yeah, the $850 million was a gross number on the proceeds
We ended up with a net number of around $500 million
What that read-through is that you had very little tax basis
in the PS&E assets through SunGard and our tax-free acquisition of SunGard
So, you ended up having a tax bill associate with that
Beyond that, we're prepaying all our prepayable debt in 2017, combination of PS&E proceeds, as well as free cash flow, and then anticipate continuing to have additional cash to be able to use for other purposes later in 2017.
If you go into the tax rate, Brett, if you go back to May, we looked at the bridge of earnings growth over the next couple of years
The tax rate was a component of that
We're just getting it a little faster than we anticipate
And to your comment with regard to revenue growth, we wanted to make sure we put together another conservative guide that we felt very comfortable being able to meet or exceed
We don't have a specific one
We talked about in May, if you look back to the guide, we talked about in May, what would drive to the lower end of the 3% to 6% and what would drive you to the higher end of the 3% to 6%
Continued higher levels of consolidation would drive you towards the lower end and that's where we're at
We're still at a high level of consolidation and there's very little to no de novo activity in the marketplace
I think the broader commentary is really going to be around continued consolidation
You've seen IFS running in the lower end of that for a few years
We've got some tailwinds specifically this year in EMV and the people-based project
But we think that that lower end, that 3% to 4% zone, is where you're at really given consolidation being the broader driver there
You had a people-based services project in IFS that was completed in the third quarter that won't recur in the first quarter
You've got accelerated EMV growth in first quarter of 2016 that will be a difficult grow over in 2017, and we had a large license renewal in the I&W, the Institutional and Wholesale Group, and global trading that will not recur in the first quarter
Those are the three biggies that are headwinds for Q1.
I'm glad you asked the question because I think I actually misspoke to on Ashwin's question
I want to make sure we've got it clear
This year we've got a $4.15 to $4.30 range I just outlined
We believe we can grow that 13% to 18% in 2018, which I still think that collective will imply $4.65, $4.68 to almost $5.00. That guidance has stayed intact
What I was trying to isolate was PS&E around the original guide would be difficult
But our range of $4.15 to $4.30 should grow 13% to 18% in 2018, to be clear
I think I misspoke earlier
I'm glad you asked the question to clarify
Yeah, the reported number, $9.2 billion, $9.241 billion is the base to grow off of
Again, you have got three moving parts
You've got the sale of PS&E of about 3 points negative
You've got our deferred revenue acquisition adjustment from the SunGard acquisition, and then we've got about a $75 million expected headwind from FX
So, you definitely got that right in terms of your base there
We still expect that to be a decliner over time
Yeah, we tried to add some color around the commentary
We believe we'll be able to prepay all our prepayable debt in 2017 and still generate excess cash flow that in late 2017 and into 2018, we could be buying back shares
