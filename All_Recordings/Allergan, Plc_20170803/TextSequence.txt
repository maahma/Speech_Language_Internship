Thanks, Brent, and good morning, everyone
Turning to slide 8, our performance this quarter reflects strong execution
In Medical Aesthetics, we're making significant investments to maximize our leadership position, sustain our long-term growth, and expand the market
The long-term prospects for this business are excellent
In Eye Care, we're maintaining our leadership position despite competitive headwinds
In CNS we're building a flagship product with VRAYLAR while maximizing value with NAMZARIC
In GI, we're building IBS leadership with LINZESS and VIBERZI
And our international business is growing steadily, anchored by Medical Aesthetics and Eye Care
These are our priorities in a snapshot
Turning to slide 9. We drove strong growth across multiple areas of our business
Revenue was up 9% over last quarter, including the addition of LifeCell and CoolSculpting
Sales for eight out of our top product lines increased at double-digit rates in the second quarter, and growth across the product portfolio is being driven primarily by volume
The Medical Aesthetics growth was led by BOTOX Cosmetic, up 13%, and our JUVÉDERM collection of fillers, up 18% excluding FX
In Eye Care, RESTASIS continues to show durability with stable demand, offset by year-over-year trade buying patterns this quarter, which did not impact RESTASIS in the first quarter
We expect buying patterns to moderate for the remainder of the year, and for RESTASIS to be at expectations for the full year
And collectively our new products including VRAYLAR, NAMZARIC, KYBELLA, VIBERZI, XEN, and RHOFADE contributed $108 million to net revenue growth compared to last year
Growth was partially offset in the quarter by continued sales erosion from NAMENDA XR, loss of exclusivity from ASACOL HD and MINASTRIN, and lower ACZONE sales that were negatively impacted by formulary coverage gaps and increased generic pressure in the category
Turning to slide 10, Medical Aesthetics is our largest and fastest growing business, as you know, and it's built on three pillars: Facial Aesthetics, Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, and Body Contouring
We're seeing strong momentum across our broad and deep portfolio
The Regenerative Medicine products and CoolSculpting are strong, and are at or above expectations
In Facial Aesthetics we had strong performance from our lead products
As I mentioned, BOTOX Cosmetic up 13% and our JUVÉDERM collection of fillers, where we have launched several new products, including VOLBELLA, VOLLURE, and VOLITE, was up 18%, and surpassed a 50% U.S
market share, marking an all-time high
In Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, sales for ALLODERM, our market-leading acellular dermal matrix for tissue support and breast reconstruction, were very strong
And the launch of INSPIRA implants continues to exceed expectations
And in Body Contouring we're off to a strong start
Sales for the quarter were up 40% pro forma excluding FX
Three takeaways here: First, the business is starting to accelerate following an increase in sales force effort and advertising
Second, system placements are at an all-time high
And consumable demand is very strong
It's early, but the growth prospects for this business and the market are excellent
With KYBELLA we have a large group of trialists, but a smaller group of adopters
We're focused on education, training, and complementary co-positioning of KYBELLA and CoolMini
The fat reduction market is still in the early innings, and it's a market we're committed to for the long term
Remember, it took the facial injectable market five to seven years to develop
We're leveraging our existing commercial infrastructure to support KYBELLA
Success in Body Contouring business will take time and result from market development and potentially new future indications for other parts of the body, including jowls, where we're focused right now, as well as arms and knees
Turning to slide 11, we continue to see Medical Aesthetics as one of the fastest growth areas of our business and one of the best markets in all of healthcare
Attitudes towards aesthetics are changing, and new demographics, including millennials and males, are expanding rapidly
There are approximately 30 million people in the United States alone who are considering an aesthetic procedure in the next one to two years
We've captured just a fraction of this potential market, as you can see on the slide: approximately 5% in Facial Aesthetics, 10% in Plastics and Regenerative Medicine, and 5% in Body Contouring
The main point here is that the long-term growth prospects for the market and our business are excellent, and this has and will continue to be a focus for Allergan
Turning to Eye Care on slide 12. In dry eye, RESTASIS continues to demonstrate durability, with stable demand and market share
Unit market share for RESTASIS is solid at approximately 80%, and the outlook for the second half is in line with expectations
RESTASIS MultiDose, which was launched several months ago, is at approximately 10% of the total line and should exit the year around 15% or higher
We expect we can continue to grow share throughout 2018. In retina, OZURDEX has been a leading growth driver across our global portfolio, up 15% ex FX in the second quarter
The growth was balanced between U.S
and international markets, with new patients coming primarily from anti-VEGF failures
And in glaucoma, we're maintaining a strong position with this highly profitable product portfolio while continuing to deliver new treatments to the market
The XEN Gel Stent is getting very positive reviews in the initial launch period
Turning to our launch products in CNS on slide 13. Demand for VRAYLAR remains strong and above expectations
It continues to be the fastest growing atypical antipsychotic on the market, and we see a long runway for VRAYLAR
We expect future growth will be driven by expanding coverage and access
Long term, we're looking to market expansion, with potential new indications such as negative symptoms, bipolar depression, and schizophrenia maintenance
With NAMZARIC the launch trajectory remains solid, and we're on track to exit the year at approximately 25% to 30% of the NAMENDA franchise
We have formulary coverage through 2018, and we'll continue to drive utilization of NAMZARIC during that period
Turning to GI on slide 14. We continue our strong presence in IBS, of course, with LINZESS and VIBERZI
LINZESS is back on its growth trajectory, up 12% in the quarter, with strong prescription demand of approximately 19%, offset primarily by year-over-year trade buying patterns
Growth catalysts for this business are the 72-microgram launch, promotional leadership, and widespread formulary coverage
With VIBERZI, prescription levels have stabilized since the FDA label update, which is a good sign
Utilization in primary care is relatively strong, but we have work to do in gastroenterology
Our promotional levels and formulary coverage are where we need them to be
We expect demand for VIBERZI to pick up in the second half of the year
Turning to slide 15. We saw another strong quarter from our international business, with sales up 16% excluding FX
In our international markets, we had operational growth in all regions, with Asia-Pacific and Middle East/Africa up 20%, Latin America/Canada up 16%, and Europe 10%
China continues to be one of the fastest-growing markets, up 61%, with others like Sweden, Spain, Brazil, and Canada also showing strong growth
We continue to have a very positive outlook for our international business
Medical Aesthetics, BOTOX Therapeutic, and Eye Care anchor our business internationally
We'll continue to focus on execution
We're halfway through the year, and our balanced portfolio of high-quality products positions us very well, both in the United States and internationally
With that, I'll turn the call over to David
Yeah
I would just say that we actively promote over 20 products, and the large majority of them at this point for the quarter are at or above expectations
But there are three, to be fair, that need some work right now, and that's VIBERZI, KYBELLA, and ACZONE
And so those generally offsetted some of the favorability from FX and XR, and that's how I'd think about it
I think that's right
If penetration rates in the category were 30% or 40% or 50%, you might think that growth rates over time would moderate, but they're not, and we showed that on the slide
You're between let's call it 5% and 10%
The two biggest trends that we think are driving business is, one, there's a millennial movement or a youth movement underway, and there's an emerging male movement, which will take time
Given our leadership position, we're at 70% to 90% of that market, depending which product lines you look at
We're focused on one thing: building the market and expanding it
If we do that, we're going to be very successful
And to answer your questions, Liav, most of the business we're talking about is balanced between customers that are satisfied with their aesthetic procedure, and then there's a large pool of new patients that are trying aesthetic procedures for the very first time, which is pretty characteristic of a market that's in growth mode
And as it relates to the formulation, David, the IV, while an oral often can be preferred, if we can replicate in the Phase 3 trials what we saw in the Phase 2 trials, my sense right now is the healthcare system is completely equipped, whether it be through infusion centers or home care centers, to deal with an IV treatment for depression
I think that statement probably may not apply if it was 20 years ago
But regular IV treatments – and this only takes about a minute to do on a weekly basis for people who have, in this case, failed multiple antidepressants and perhaps are suffering from suicidal thoughts and behaviors – it doesn't seem like it's going to be a big obstacle to me
And so the potential for rapastinel, I don't really think, trades on whether we have an oral formulation or not
Marc, I think this market ultimately splits between long-acting agents and short-acting agents, or cheap agents
And when it comes to something that's long-acting, I think abicipar, if we show that 90% of people preserve vision and 30% get an improvement in vision, I don't think there's another long-acting agent out there that's going to have a better profile than that, in an every-four-month, or even longer period
And so I think – I don't see the findings from any of the other companies impacting what our view of the potential of abicipar is
But we have to of course watch it
On the international front, what I would look at over the next several years in terms of growth drivers – I'll talk about the marketed products first
BOTOX and fillers, internationally those businesses in most regions of the country are up 20% to 30%
And as Brent said, the international market has a long way to go as it relates to aesthetics procedures and probably has even more headroom than the U.S
In Eye Care, our fastest-growing product is OZURDEX across the board
And then in terms of new product launches, XEN, which is the glaucoma surgical procedure that we just introduced, probably the best IOP-lowering procedure on the market
And then I'd watch abicipar, of course, which we just talked about, and BELKYRA, which is approved in over a dozen countries around the world
And that's how I think about the international piece
Gregg, on ESMYA we're not going to have to add any infrastructure to support the launch of ESMYA
We have coverage of obviously the OB/GYN space or segment, primary care, and any institutions that we need to cover, and of course the payer environment
So there's certainly leverage there
As it relates to VIBERZI, the problem that we're focused on right now is retraining over 500 gastroenterologists around the country to talk about the new label change and to put into proper context the benefit-risk profile of VIBERZI
At the same time, we're continuing to improve coverage for the product
I don't see that as being a problem for us going forward
It's progressing along with expectations
And in terms of ACZONE, the distribution model there is in flux
As I mentioned, there are formulary coverage gaps that we need to close given the genericization of the category
There a lot of generic retinoids, generic anti-inflammatories, generic antibiotics that are being promoted
And it's something we have to manage
With ACZONE, we've been successful moving from 5.0% to 7.5%
In fact, we've converted 70% of the business over a relatively short period of time
We have an underlying demand problem that we're solving for because of the availability of generic alternatives
I think it can be managed, but it's just going to take a little bit of time
The only thing I'd add about VIBERZI, I think Brent's right, is I don't believe it's something fundamental
We're adding on a consistent basis weekly a lot of new writers
And by the time the year finishes, we'll probably have 20,000 or 30,000 writers
The PCP part of the story looks good, and as I mentioned during the first part of the call, new patient starts in gastroenterology over the past four weeks are up 10%, which I think is a good sign of a recovery
And, as far as I could tell, this should be in good shape as we move through the second half of the year
As it relates to BOTOX Migraine and how we're thinking about it relative to the CGRPs, I think there are, depending on which estimate you use, 3 million to 5 million people that suffer from chronic migraine, and there's roughly – as successful as we've been with BOTOX in migraine – there's under 200,000 receiving BOTOX treatment
And so there's plenty of opportunity in this market for BOTOX to coexist with the CGRPs
Whether they're used sequentially or together I think remains to be seen
Of course, they haven't been studied together
I would just remind you, Chris, that when you look at the data on BOTOX in the treatment of chronic migraine, it's as good as anything that's been published by the CGRPs, which means it produces roughly a 50% reduction in headaches on a monthly basis
And the responder rates, if you look at that kind of an analysis, are also 50%
In terms of the benefit-risk profile of BOTOX, it's probably as well-understood as any product in the world
And then, finally, it's the biggest bargain, as I've said many times in the past, effectively $5 to $7 a day depending on how you look at it
And so my sense is we can sustain growth for BOTOX through the launches of CGRPs that are maybe an interruption for a quarter or two
I think the bigger story about the market is that it's completely untreated, and there's a lot of off-label use of products like opioids and TCAs and things like that
David, in terms of just the overall picture here, I would describe it as very stable and manageable at this point
I think LINZESS has a pretty commanding lead of the category relative to Amitiza or Trulance
I don't think that that's going to change
Our formulary coverage is as strong as it's ever been
I think we're managing price-volume in a good way
The average patient on LINZESS is paying $30 or $40 a month, or $1 a day, for LINZESS
Our ASP is pretty stable on a quarterly or annual basis, and I don't see anything derailing the growth rate for this business over the next several years
We just launched the 72-microgram, which I think was perfect timing, given some of the competitive activity
I would say the most encouraging finding so far from that launch is that 80% of use for the 72-microgram dose is coming from the over-the-counter market or from other businesses as opposed to the 145 microgram
And it's just a great product, and gastros love it, and so do primary care physicians
And we're going to continue to invest in it
We have a patent that extends well into the next decade
And our primary objective right now is volume and market share, and that's how we're thinking about it
I mean, it's early as you pointed out, Ken, but it passed Mirvaso
We have 3,000 dermatologists in the United States that have used it
So far, the feedback that we've gotten is very positive
Formulary coverage is developing
In fact, RHOFADE was just added to the formulary at Caremark
Some forms of direct-to-consumer advertising have just started
In fact this week, we're advertising on Facebook, and then we'll, over the next several quarters, begin to ramp up other aspects of the consumer program
And our aim is to produce a multi-hundred-million-dollar dermatology product
That's how we're thinking about it, and so far it looks good, but it's early
Ronny, I think you're right on RESTASIS
We're very pleased at where we are
Our market share and volume is exactly where we wanted it to be a year ago
For modeling purposes, you're right
There's going to be some downward pressure on price
Competition for formulary coverage right now is high
I will tell you that as I sit here right now 2018 for RESTASIS in Part D and commercial is going to look as it did in 2017. And so not all, but some of the discounts that we're providing to obtain formulary coverage will be covered by improved volume or preserved volume in 2018. And, as we both know, I think one of the things Shire did prove is that the category is underdeveloped and that there are more people being treated for dry eye today that there were a year ago
And while the category may not grow at quite the same rate in 2018 that it did through parts of 2016 and 2017, it's still going to expand
And that's how I think about it
(1:18:15) You know that 30% to 40% of our sales is coming from roughly, or a little bit more, from migraine, and that's the fastest-growing part of the business
I don't have the breakdown in front of me, but we could follow up at some time
Yeah
On NAMZARIC, if XR loses exclusivity in 2018, I think as a base case we keep whatever we've moved over to NAMZARIC
The one positive here is that over half of the sales and utilization for NAMZARIC today isn't coming from NAMENDA XR but is coming from ARICEPT 5 and 10 milligrams
And that a unique situation
And I don't want to overestimate what we can do with NAMZARIC in 2018 in the face of memantine XR, but we may be able to at least maintain the business, as I said, and potentially show some increased sales in 2018 given that situation
And I've always said with these types of line extensions, it's a great product, but it's a line extension
If you can get into that 30% to 50% range – right now we're trading at the lower end of it – you have a pretty good product
And I continue to think that about NAMZARIC, and as I said here today and I've mentioned it on other calls, we have coverage for NAMZARIC all the way through the end of 2018. As it relates to sarecycline, I think you're exactly right, Dave
That is a good analogy, which is it could be a RHOFADE-like product
Yeah, sarecycline could be a – the RHOFADE analogy
It could be a multi-hundred-million-dollar dermatology product
You have retinoids and antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, and it looks like the tolerability profile of this one looks pretty good, and it's going to be an alternative to doxycycline and minocycline, and that's how we're modeling it
