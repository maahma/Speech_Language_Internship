- The insights gained could support investment decisions and complement quantitative data, such as financial reports

## Learning Goals
- Gain a strong understanding of Speech and Language Processing (SLP) concepts
- Acquire hands-on experience with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that extract meaningful information from speech and text data
- Develop a comprehensive understanding of how ML pipelines function, from data preprocessing to model deployment
- Learn how to effectively read and interpret research papers, exploring relevant models and datasets that align with my use case
- Expand knowledge beyond ML by learning useful tools like Regular Expressions (Regex), Bash scripting, and working with High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments
- Enhance debugging skills for troubleshooting and optimizing model performance
- Improve organizational and time management abilities to stay efficient and focused throughout the internship
