Q3 results include revenue of $1.6 billion, up 7% versus last year, including approximately $40 million of revenue from acquisitions
Organic revenue was up 5%
GAAP operating earnings of $338 million, down $3 million from last year, non-GAAP operating earnings were $423 million, up 7% or $27 million from the prior year
Operating margins were 25.7% of sales, comparable to last year
GAAP earnings per share was $1.25, up 11% from $1.13 last year
Non-GAAP EPS was $1.53, up 12% from $1.37 last year
Ending backlog was $8.9 billion, up $768 million from last year
Product backlog was up $344 million and Services backlog was up $424 million
For the remainder of the call, we'll reference non-GAAP financial results including those in our outlook unless otherwise noted
Q3 product sales were $989 million, up 8% from last year, led by North America and EMEA on continued demand for P25 systems for both public safety and commercial customers
Q3 Product segment operating income was $287 million or 29% of sales, up 260 basis points from last year, driven primarily by higher sales and lower OpEx
Gross margins were flat compared to the prior year
Product segment backlog ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, up $344 million or 24% versus last year
This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth
Sequentially, Products backlog was up $203 million or 13%
The year-over-year and sequential backlog growth continues to be driven by North America, which had 13 P25 system orders valued at over $10 million each
Turning to Services; Q3 services revenue was $656 million, up 7% from last year
Our Managed & Support services revenue grew 8%
Services operating income was $136 million or 20.7% of sales, down from 25% last year
As expected, gross margins returned to the mid-30s from the high 30s in the year ago quarter
As previously noted, we continue to expect gross margins in the mid-30% range for the Services segment
Additionally, OpEx was up $10 million in the segment, primarily as a result of acquisitions
Services backlog ended at $7.1 billion, up $424 million or 6% from last year, including approximately $400 million of Airwave backlog reduction
Sequentially, Services backlog is up $228 million, including $116 million of favorable currency adjustments
Services backlog continues to be driven primarily by North America demand for long-term Managed & Support services contract
Moving to operating expenses; total OpEx from continuing operations was $375 million, up $5 million from the year-ago quarter, inclusive of $12 million related to acquisitions
Other income and expense was $52 million compared to $48 million in the year-ago quarter
The Q3 effective tax rate was 29.9%
Turning to cash flow; Q3 operating cash flow was $270 million, a decrease of $78 million from last year, driven by higher working capital associated with the ERP implementation and higher tax payments
Free cash flow was $185 million, a decrease of $95 million from last year
From a trailing 12-month perspective, free cash flow was up $20 million
We expect approximately $1.2 billion in operating cash flow for 2017. We ended Q3 with cash of $717 million and a net debt position of $3.8 billion
During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of stock at an average price of $87.54 and we paid dividends of $76 million
Additionally, we paid $205 million in cash related to the acquisition of Kodiak
Today, we also announced an increase to our quarterly dividend of 11% to $0.52 per share
Turning to our outlook; we are raising our Q4 and full-year guidance
We expect Q4 revenue growth of approximately 3% with non-GAAP EPS between $2 and $2.05. We now expect full-year 2017 revenue growth of approximately 5% versus our previous forecast of 3% to 4%
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $5.35 to $5.40, an increase from the prior outlook of $5.20 to $5.30. This assumes a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 169 million shares
Full-year operating expenses are expected to be $1.48 billion, down approximately $15 million from 2016, including approximately $45 million of OpEx from acquisitions
We expect the full-year 2017 effective tax rate to be approximately 32% and operating cash flow is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion for the year
Looking at regional results; Americas revenue was up 9%, driven by organic growth of 5% in North America
This growth was driven by strong demand for P25 Products and Services, as well as demand for PCR products, serving commercial customers
Backlog is also up more than $1.2 billion year-over-year and up more than $500 million sequentially, as customers continue to invest in LMR solutions for the long term
EMEA was up 6% on strong demand in products, while backlog was down from the Airwave revenue conversion
Asia Pac was up 1%, primarily driven by Services
Finally, I'd like to end with some notable segment highlights
In our Products segment, we won several deals that include a $79 million award to deploy a P25 system for three counties in the State of Oregon; a $54 million award for a P25 system in Memphis, Tennessee; and a $24 million award for a P25 system in Burlington, New Jersey
In our Services segment, we were awarded three new Managed & Support contracts that extend support for P25 networks through the year 2028. These include a $26 million support contract in the Phoenix area, a $12 million contract for Stafford County, Virginia and a $10 million regional contract in Georgia
Additionally, from a technology perspective, we introduced the PSX Application Suite, providing push-to-talk, messaging and mapping applications designed specifically for public safety LTE users
We announced responder alert, technology that triggers automatic alerts to the command center for events such as weapon drawn or fired
The Motorola Public Safety LTE LEX F10 handset and the VML 750 vehicular modem were added to the FirstNet
com website and AT&T's speed portal
And finally, we closed the acquisition of Kodiak Networks, which provides push-to-talk over cellular solutions in North America, Latin America and Europe for customers such as AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, Bell Canada and Telefónica
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Greg
Sure, Stanley
I'll start with full year organic growth
Embedded in that number is organic growth of between 2% and 3% and that includes iDEN down $45 million in 2017. With respect to FX for the full year, it's de minimis
It's a push for the quarter based on rates right now approximately $20 million to $25 million in the Q4 – in our Q4 number
Vijay
Kyle, this is Gino
From a Q4 perspective, aged entering into the quarter, we are better aged entering Q4 than we were last year at the end of Q3. And you started the comment with Q4 not being the largest quarter
Q4 will still be our largest quarter
And if you look at it from a percentage perspective, from a linearity perspective, it's within a point or so of the normal linearity that we would experience during any particular year
Thanks, Kyle
